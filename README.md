This repository includes data files and code to create visualisations in R which were used in the completion of my MSc Project entitle "What questions are computer science educators asking?" as the final part of my MSc in Computer Science & Data Analytics at the University of Keele.
The XML files are the original files downloaded from the StackExchange data dump accessed on 6th April 2024 and pertaining to the Computer Science Educators SE forum. 
The Data Analysis.xslx file contains the filtered data along with metadata and categorisation undertaken as part of my content analysis. 
The R source files provide the code used to produce the visualisations used within the project, the calculation of Krippendorff's alpha for interrater reliability and the attempted use of Latent Dirichlet Allocation.
