248,1,259,,28/05/2017 09:21,,12,681,"<p>Automatic grading is great for saving time on marking programming tasks, so there's more time to focus on actual <em>teaching</em>, but I've noticed a few flaws. Since work is essentially marked based on passing unit tests, thoughtful design often gets ignored, and excessively complex solutions are considered just as good as elegant ones.</p>

<p>I recently read <a href=""http://gregorulm.com/automatic-grading-of-code-submissions-in-moocs-isnt-perfect-either/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this article</a> about how this is a problem on MITx—instead of this solution:</p>

<pre><code>return max(min(hi,x),lo)
</code></pre>

<p>A student wrote this:</p>

<pre><code>1 * lo + 0 * x + 0 * hi # too low
0 * lo + 1 * x + 0 * hi # in range
0 * lo + 0 * x + 1 * hi # too high
</code></pre>

<p>Automatic testing would find these equivalent,  but clearly one is incomprehensible and the other is relatively logical and sound.</p>

<p>This is also recognised in <a href=""http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/cs257/archive/stephen-edwards/automated-feedback.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>Using Test-Driven Development in the Classroom</em></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despite its classroom utility, an automatic grading strategy like
  the one embodied in the Curator also has a number of shortcomings:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Students focus on output correctness first and foremost;
  all other considerations are a distant second at best (design,
  commenting, appropriate use of abstraction, testing one's
  own code, etc.). This is due to the fact that the most immediate
  feedback students receive is on output correctness [...]</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there any way of evaluating code style and design automatically (or at least detecting very poor solutions)? I've thought about using some static code analysis to try and evaluate solutions (e.g. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity"" rel=""noreferrer"">cyclomatic complexity</a>, or tools like <a href=""https://github.com/mre/awesome-static-analysis"" rel=""noreferrer"">these</a>), although I've not tried them yet. Are there any reliable solutions to this, or must it be done manually? Does static code analysis help in any way?</p>

<p>For context, my kids come into their junior year knowing Java, C, and Python pretty well.  For their junior year, it was decided that there should be a course in theoretical computer science.  In order to have labs, I further decided that we should move away from imperative programming and expose the kids to a functional language.  So, while the class was not <em>about</em> functional programming, the kids did quite a lot of it.</p>

<p>I used Scheme (DrRacket, to be specific), but over the course of the year, I found that kids were sneaking <code>set</code> functions into their labs, which ran (to my thinking) counter to the goals of the class.  I was also a little displeased with the rather unintuitive way that boolean functions and contracts interacted in the language.</p>

<p>I have, as a result, been thinking about migrating over to Haskell.  If I did this, I know that I would need to redesign my labs (and I wonder if the Turing Machines I have them design would suddenly run very slowly!) </p>

<p>Currently, our assembly class uses 6502, which has 6 registers (including flags), and a very limited number of commands.  This might end up being our best choice for integrating into processors, as I have not found anything simpler yet.</p>

<p>As far as the processor design class is concerned, 8-bit machines are about twice as good as 16-bit machines, and about 4x as good as 32-bit machines, and I'd like to keep the number of registers down to a manageable number.  6502's 6 registers is pretty reasonable.</p>

<p>The only assembly language for beginners that I have found is ACSL assembly, but it lacks a memory bus entirely (so no stack).  Are there other languages that I am overlooking?</p>

<p>The classic way to explain them is to say that <em>they are like interfaces, but can implement methods</em>.

(Interestingly, the <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/abstract.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">JavaDoc commits this particular sin</a>.)  At no point in that discussion do we even try to get at the intuitive heart of what abstract classes <em>really are</em>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, classes can also be declared ""abstract"" even if everything is fully implemented and there are no abstract methods at all, which the programmer can do simply to make sure that the class cannot be instantiated directly.  </p>

<p>This lends itself to a different kind of explanation.  We could say that ""Abstract classes represent abstract ideas, so that means that we can't instantiate them, and they can declare methods that must be implemented by child-classes.""  But, of course, they can have constructor methods.  This seems mysterious until you realize that <strong>they are instantiated</strong> during constructor-chaining, so saying that they can't ever be instantiated is really not true.</p>

<p>I can think of no explanation for abstract classes that really gets to their essential nature.  Has anyone else found an elegant way to describe them?</p>

<p>This is the first unit in junior year for a course in theoretical computer science.  Prior to this, the students have already had AP CS A and a mish-mash of other topics.  They have, by this point, studied:</p>

<ol>
<li>Python (as their introduction to programming)</li>
<li>Java for AP CS A (loops, arrays, object design, recursion, polymorphism)</li>
<li>6502 Assembly (for stack operation, including recursion again)</li>
<li>C (largely for pointers)</li>
<li>Additional things in Java (e.g. trees, linked lists, tries, Hashmaps, generics) and some algorithms (such as BFS, DFS, Huffman Encoding, Conway's Game of Life, Prim's, etc)</li>
</ol>

<p>This course, then, is a year of theoretical computer science.  The first unit is background mathematics that they will need during the rest of the course, and it focuses on boolean algebra and sets.  The requested Unit Review here is for my boolean algebra opening.</p>

<p>The general goals are to help the students gain serious familiarity with algebraic manipulations and with the symbols themselves.  After these lessons, we will move onto Conjunctive and Disjunctive Normal Forms, fairly substantial algebraic manipulations involving 5-10 steps, and then into logic gates for a gentle introduction to computer circuitry, so it is important that they come out prepared for that.</p>

<p><strong>Word of warning:</strong> The unit below has some serious weaknesses, as you will see.  Please be gentle!  This year will be my second time giving these lessons, and while I have made a series of improvements from what I did this last September, there is still a long way to go.  There is a lot of lecture, and I would really like to make it more engaging when I do it again27.</p>

<h1>The Curriculum</h1>

<p><strong>Lesson one:</strong></p>

<p>We begin our foray into boolean algebra by converting our Java boolean symbols to formal math symbology: <code>&amp;&amp;</code> to $\land$, <code>||</code> to $\lor$, and <code>!</code> to $\lnot$.  We then discuss how <code>!=</code> is essentially $\oplus$, and begin our discussion of $\Longleftrightarrow$ as being a near approximation of <code>==</code> (with a promise that we will come back to this again, because we are not done with it yet). </p>

<p>We then introduce tautologies (such as $B \lor \lnot B$), and go over their truth tables.  I finally provide them with an extremely short homework worksheet where they have to circle the boolean statements that are tautologies.  (It also provides practice with all of the symbols we have discussed)</p>

<p><strong>Lesson two:</strong></p>

<p>We review lesson 1, and then introduce the concept of <em>contradictions</em> as the opposite of tautologies, go over their truth tables, and look at the obvious contradiction $B \land \lnot B$.</p>

<p>I ask them to create two tautologies with a partner, the more creative the better, walk around, and ask for a number of students to write interesting ones on the board.</p>

<p>We move on to $A \Rightarrow B$, discuss its meaning and truth table, and then ask what in Java is similar?  I first propose:</p>

<pre><code> if (A)
     B = true;
</code></pre>

<p>We talk about this for awhile, and talk about why, though it may seem like a reasonable choice at first, it is not really the same idea.  We then spend some time on the hardest idea of <em>implies:</em> what we mean when we say that $False \Rightarrow True$ is $True$.</p>

<p>At this point, I take a break to introduce the way I approach proofs in this class.  Over the course of the year, certain very important proofs must be reproduced by a student chosen at random during the following period.  This forces the students not to ignore these proofs, and helps them to internalize both the mathematical symbols that I need them to gain fluency with, and some very clever proof techniques.</p>

<p>I spend a substantial chunk of time then doing a formal proof that $False \Rightarrow True \equiv True$.  I finish the class with a second, informal, and intuitive proof of the same (which they will not need to reproduce.)</p>

<p><strong>Lesson 3:</strong></p>

<p>We review from the prior day, and a student is called up to reproduce the proof.  </p>

<p>We then spend about 15 minutes going over <em>necessary</em> and <em>sufficient</em> in depth, and re-examine both $\Longleftrightarrow$ and $\Rightarrow$ through this new lense.  During this process, I introduce $\Longleftrightarrow$ more properly as $(A \Rightarrow B) \land (A \Leftarrow B)$ and as <strong>iff</strong>, and we talk about the similarities that $\Longleftrightarrow$ shares with $\equiv$.</p>

<p>I go over <strong>DeMorgan's Laws</strong>, and briefly cover 5 more symbols: ∀, ∃, |, ∈, and ∴.</p>

<p>At this point, I give them <em>English statements</em> to translate to <em>mathematical statements</em>, and <em>mathematical statements</em> to translate to <em>English statements</em>, one at a time.  <em>We use the following format:</em> I provide an exercise, they work on it with a buddy or on their own while I bounce around the room offering help, and then I go over how we do it.  The final exercise is to translate Goldbach's Conjecture (which I do not identify to them until after the translation work is done) from boolean symbology into English:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$\forall n|n \gt 2 \wedge (\frac{n}{2}) \in \mathbb{N}$, </p>
  
  <p>$\exists (m,ℓ)\,\,|\,\, m \in P \wedge ℓ \in P \wedge m+ℓ=n$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As they leave, I give them a homework assignment with practice problems in very simple 1- or 2-step boolean algebraic reductions (including applying DeMorgan's Law), translating statements from English back and forth into symbols, creating truth tables from algebraic statements, and creating algebraic statements from truth tables.</p>

<h1>The Request</h1>

<p>This is my opener for the year, and it is <em>so. very. dry.</em>  There is also very little activity!  I am already aware that I've got a real snoozer here.</p>

<p>This material must to come first in the year for large-scale organizational reasons, but I would really like ideas to make it more engaging. <em>I am also particularly seeking out ideas for <strong>active learning</strong> and ways to utilize <strong>pair partners</strong> to improve both engagement and mastery.</em></p>

<p>This is mid-year in a course for HS juniors in theoretical computer science.  The unit is about Information Theory.  We were using the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_puzzle"" rel=""noreferrer"">coin-weighing problem</a> as something of a motivator for the entire enterprise, as a deep understanding of that problem would also engender a pretty reasonable understanding of the purpose and use of the four axioms of Information Theory:</p>

<ol>
<li>I(p) ≥ 0</li>
<li>I(1) = 0</li>
<li>I(p1 * p2) = I(p1) + I(p2)</li>
<li>I is continuous and monotonic</li>
</ol>

<p>In the lectures prior to this lab, we cover the coin problem, the axioms themselves, some of the derived properties of the axioms, bits, trits <em>(including the Soviet Setun computers)</em>, nats, and Hartleys, how much information is present in random and constrained events, the concept or entropy, and how to calculate the storage requirements of a theoretically maximal lossless data compression given some set of rules.</p>

<p>In covering the coin problem itself, we actually visit it three times, spread out among the lessons above.  At first, I simply introduce the problem and have the kids try to solve it for some small numbers of coins.  Later, we revisit the coin problem and show how we would solve some larger problems, and draw some generalized conclusions from these solutions.  Finally, at our third visit, we derive a generalized algorithm for what steps you could use to figure out a next optimal weighing.</p>

<h1>The Lab</h1>

<p>The lab is in Scheme, and asks students to create a function that provides the proper weighings to solve a game.  The entire lab write-up comes in at a whopping <em>8 pages</em>, so I won't put that all here, but this is the opening that describes the problem:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your goal is to create a function called <code>playgame</code> that takes arguments like so:</p>
  
  <p><code>(define sampleGame '((u . 1) (u . 2) (u . 3) (u . 4) (G . 5)))</code><BR>
   <code>(playgame 4 'H sampleGame)</code></p>
  
  <p>In the game example above, the real answer is that coin 4 is heavy.  But coming into the problem, coins 1-4 are unknown, and coin 5 is a reference coin.  The data encodings are like so:</p>
  
  <p><code>'u – unknown, could be light, heavy, or good</code><BR>
  <code>'l – could be light or good (heavy has been eliminated as a possibility)</code><BR>
   <code>'h – could be heavy or good (light has been eliminated as a possibility)</code><BR>
   <code>'L – coin is Light.  This is a final answer state.</code><BR>
   <code>'H – coin is Heavy.  This is a final answer state.</code><BR>
   <code>'G – coin is good.</code><BR></p>
  
  <p>All games with <code>'G</code> are considered to be equivalent, so a designation of no false coins can be made with any coin number.</p>
  
  <p>The function call above would have an output like:<BR>
  <code>Game of ((u . 1) (u . 2) (u . 3) (u . 4) (G . 5))</code><BR>
  <code>With real answer that coin 4 is H</code><BR>
  <code>Move 0: (((u . 4) (u . 1)) ((G . 5) (u . 2)) ((u . 3)))</code><BR>
  <code>result: ((h . 4) (h . 1) (G . 5) (l . 2) (G . 3))</code><BR>
  <code>Move 1: (((h . 4)) ((h . 1)) ((G . 5) (l . 2) (G . 3)))</code><BR>
  <code>result: ((H . 4) (G . 1) (G . 5) (G . 2) (G . 3))</code><BR>
  <code>Game finished in 2 moves</code></p>
  
  <p>There are many possible ways to get the answer.  In your lab, don’t be concerned with whether you are weighing coin 4 vs coin 1 instead of coin 2 versus coin 4.  What matters is that every move is legal, and that your weighings will always find the answer within the minimum number of steps.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What follows on that same page is a recap (and explanation) of the algorithm for figuring out the next move that we derived together in class.</p>

<p>The lab itself turned out to be <em>extremely difficult</em>, even when I did it on my own.  I don't like to shrink back from course targets.  I would prefer to scaffold until every student can meet the goal.  So, I had to find a way to make it more manageable.  I arrived at the following strategy, which I confess I thought quite innovative at the time:</p>

<p>I created the lab itself in segments, each with more hints, discussion, and code organization.  If you ultimately read through the entire lab write-up, you would eventually the method header and description for every one of the 28 functions in my own personal (idiosyncratic) solution, as well as additional hints, thoughts, and alerts to some programming traps.</p>

<p>At the bottom of each section, I had a message like this: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you stop here and complete the problem correctly, you will be able to earn <strong>100%</strong>. <BR>
  If you go on to the next page, you will only be able to earn <strong>94%</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The notion was to allow for self-selected scaffolding to make the lab more possible. The earnings per section were originally set to 105, 100, 94, and 80.  (The big gap for the last section was because the last section basically just laid out every little detail.)  This setup, I believed, would provide a challenge to those who could handle it, and support for those who needed.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>How things went down</strong></p>

<p>When the lab went live, it did not go at all as I expected.  The students at my highly selective school were far, far more resistant to going on to the next section than I had anticipated, and preferred instead to work at a level that was inappropriately hard.  Most students refused to go below 100% for any reason whatsoever, and the students who could really have benefited from the 80% section would not go past 94%.  Some students never completed the lab at all, ironically garnering a zero in an attempt to avoid a 94%.</p>

<p>More perturbing to me were assertions that there were other students who were cheating, since the sections you actually read were on your own honor.  My protestations that my solution was, in fact, highly idiosyncratic (and therefore it would be easy to tell) did nothing to dispel this idea.  Later, upon analysis, I did find at least one student who definitely did read beyond the section that he declared, but that was all I was able to find.</p>

<p>This whole episode took a tremendous amount of class time, and ate substantially into the good will I had built over the last two years with the class.</p>

<p><em>Innovation?  Meet near-abject failure.</em></p>

<h1>The Request</h1>

<p>I have already made a pass at addressing some of the problems the kids identified for this next school year.  First of all, I have integrated the coin problem far more tightly into the lecture materials.  I have further added new hints and clarifications across the entire text of the lab, and I have changed the point values for the sections to: 105, 100, 96, and 90.</p>

<p>With these modifications, the lab will be incrementally better on a number of fronts.  However, I can't help but think that my approach is foundationally wrong here.  I don't see how to entirely avoid many of the problems that I encountered the first time.</p>

<p>How can I scaffold the lab more appropriately <em>without retreating on the final product?</em>  I believe that the exercise has real value, and I don't want to simply retreat into lab material that is inherently less rich.</p>

2982,1,,,28/07/2017 16:58,,6,185,"<p>This question is somewhat related to a <a href=""https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/2530/review-of-information-theory-lab"">prior question</a> that I asked about an Information Theory lab.  I received a lot of great feedback there, but I have not gotten past the idea yet that the lab that I assigned last year was simply too hard.  I have been wracking my brain to think of a new lab idea, but so far, I have come up empty-handed.</p>

<p>So you don't have to visit the prior question, here is the relevant portion: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is mid-year in a course for HS juniors in theoretical computer science.  The unit is about Information Theory.  We were using the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_puzzle"" rel=""noreferrer"">coin-weighing problem</a> as something of a motivator for the entire enterprise, as a deep understanding of that problem would also engender a pretty reasonable understanding of the purpose and use of the four axioms of Information Theory:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>I(p) ≥ 0</li>
  <li>I(1) = 0</li>
  <li>I(p1 * p2) = I(p1) + I(p2)</li>
  <li>I is continuous and monotonic</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>In the lectures prior to this lab, we cover the coin problem, the axioms themselves, some of the derived properties of the axioms, bits, trits <em>(including the Soviet Setun computers)</em>, nats, and Hartleys, how much information is present in random and constrained events, the concept or entropy, and how to calculate the storage requirements of a theoretically maximal lossless data compression given some set of rules.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All of the coding done by students during this course is in Scheme, so labs that naturally lend themselves to functional programming paradigms instead of imperative ones are appreciated.  My best labs tend to present a series of very short lab assignments, and either present them in escalating order of difficulty, or provide some options to the students about which ones to pursue, to smaller-scale ideas are also a better fit for my class structure.</p>

<p>This eventually results in me going to sit down at my own station to do other work for about 10 minutes, and then making the rounds again.</p>

<p>This feels like an underutilization of myself as a resource. It's not as if I don't have students who struggle, and there are always students who fall behind and submit their labs late.</p>

<p>In both of these cases, multiple auto-casts are made during the evaluation of the statement, and in both cases, the final determination is a boolean that is passed into some sort of control structure.</p>

<p>In my work with gifted students, the most that I have ever had to do to help someone understand statements like these is to do a simple trace.  We write the statement down, mark each item by its type, and then cross off areas of the statement (and write down the new types) as we walk through the evaluation.  This method has worked pretty consistently with my students at my day-job.</p>

<p>I have had, on occasion, to step all the way back to the idea of folders, directories, and directory trees for confused students, but these conversations always get muddled.

<p>Our so-called techno-natives have real difficulties with this, since phones and taskbars hide directory structures almost entirely.  This problem is especially easy to spot the first time a student is introduced to a command line, when I may have a conversation like this:</p>

<p><em>You are currently in your home directory.  Type <code>cd somedir</code> and press enter.  Great!  We have changed our directory to <code>somedir</code>.  Now type <code>cd somesubdir</code>... where are we now?""</em>'</p>

<p>Some students know, but some are genuinely lost.  The idea of going back up a directory <code>cd ..</code>, or that <code>ls</code> lists the items <em>at your current location,</em> is so opaque that the question itself doesn't even seem to make sense.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Class Structure</strong>: the coupling of data with relevant methods.</li>
<li><strong>Information Hiding</strong>: making each class responsible to guarantee the integrity of its data.</li>
<li><strong>Designing the API</strong>: Given what we've learned, how should we design the public face of our classes?  Included in this section is the concept of overloading.</li>
<li><strong>Inheritance</strong>: Creating relationships among classes, inheriting and overriding.</li>
<li><strong>Polymorphism</strong>: Being able to utilize children in place of their parents, and how that works.</li>

4126,1,,,04/01/2018 20:04,,5,218,"<p>I'm sure that basically every introductory course involves teaching about the ubiquitous mod operation.  In my experience, and I'm sure I'm not alone in this, I've found that teaching my students that ""mod is the remainder of division"" is insufficient if I want them to make any use of the concept later on.</p>

<p>Beyond showing them how to use mod to check divisibility, I have for the last few years gone into far more interesting operations in order to help them achieve some intuitive understanding of what mod is and how it works.  So, for instance, I show them how they can increment within a modular circle of numbers from <code>0</code> to <code>n-1</code> (a circle of size <code>n</code>):</p>

<pre><code>[some loop structure] {
    x = (x+1)%n;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or, how to move that circle along so that it ranges from <code>m</code> to <code>(m+n-1)</code> (still a circle of size <code>n</code>, but it no longer starts at <code>0</code>):</p>

<pre><code>[some loop structure] {
    x = (x+1-m)%n+m;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or how to decrement along a <code>0</code> to <code>n-1</code> circle in a language like Java, which deals with negative modular operations by returning the highest negative congruence (ie. <code>-10 % 4</code> would return <code>-2</code> instead of <code>2</code>.  While they are both technically correct answers, Java's answer is decidedly inconvenient for the purpose of moving along a modular circle of numbers, because when you try to move from 0 back to <code>n-1</code>, you get the wrong result.)</p>

<pre><code>[some loop structure] {
    x = (((x-1)%n)+n)%n;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or, doing the same thing by moving <code>n-1</code> steps clockwise around the circle instead of moving <code>1</code> step counterclockwise:</p>

<pre><code>[some loop structure] {
    x = (x+n-1)%n;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And, of course, we can generalize this to involve any cyclical pattern of numbers that can be reduced to a proper modular circle where $f(n)$ is the function that takes any number within the cycle to its corresponding location in the modular circle, and $g(n)$ is the function that takes it back:</p>

<pre><code>[some loop structure] {
    x = g(f(x+1)%n);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I am reasonable certain that nobody uses structures like this in any production environment.  Part of my justification for going to such lengths with mod operators has been that I am not a teacher of software engineering.  I am a teacher of computer science, and having a firm understanding of modular arithmetic is important for Some Big Ideas later on.  (Like Two's Complement, which has a very intuitive and coherent explanation when you think about it in terms of cycles within a number space.)  And when all is said and done, many of my students really do come out with a good, intuitive sense of how the mod operation works.</p>

<p>But I also wonder if I have just gone plum crazy.  This stuff takes a lot of class time to get the kids to master, and I'm really wondering if the time would be better spent on other pursuits.</p>

They're not truly variable.  It's a subtle distinction, but I find it beautiful, and I also believe that it is a nice lead-in to that aspect of functional programming.</li>

<p>However, it has come to my attention that, perhaps due to a course structure which gives students lots of chances to re-demonstrate mastery if they initially struggle, a certain number of the students are only half-engaged with my lecture.  Since I realized this, I have spoken to a few of them, and they agree that the lessons are fun, but say that they are stressed by other courses, and sometimes this causes them to work on other things.</p>

c. int temp2 = fst[fst.length];
d. fst[0] = fst[fst.length-1];
e. fst[fst.length] = fst[0];
f. fst[0] = temp2;

My students are well aware of this, and signed up for the course fully knowing that I would be exploring alongside them.  They are pretty enthusiastic to learn together, particularly since software engineering is an extremely rare topic for high schools.  They have all completed AP Computer Science A, meaning that they are familiar with object basics, polymorphism, etc.</p>
<p>I heard from a friend whose graduate degree is in SE that her professor had assigned student presentations about design patterns, and it seems like a good idea to me. I would like to assign groups to each learn about, and present, one pattern to the class.  My current thought is to ask the students to structure their lessons thusly:</p>
<ul>
<li>A description of the pattern itself (what is it?). Have students already seen it?  (Such as factory pattern with iterators)</li>
<li>A working toy example of the pattern c#/unity (our platform for the course) to be share with their classmates</li>
<li>A uml diagram of the toy example</li>
<li>A uml diagram of the pattern in general (can be taken straight from the web)</li>
<li>Lead a discussion about when the pattern would be appropriate</li>
<li>Any other considerations that seem appropriate or important about the pattern</li>
<li>A small review quiz to be shared with the class (as learning reinforcement)</li>

<p>I figure that each group will have roughly 40 minutes to present, and 10 minutes out of a 50 minute period the next day for their reinforcement quiz.</p>
<p>Here are my questions:</p>
<p>Does this seem reasonable given the topic?  Are there elements that I am missing that are specific to design patterns?  Should I allow students to freely pick from the design patterns, or should I restrict them to easier ones?  Is there anything else I should know before embarking on this path with my students?</p>

<p>How do you create a final exam that is a valid assessment of an entire year or computer science, but can still be completed in a couple of hours? Ideally I think a large-ish scale project would be the best assessment of where the kids are. But two hours just isn't enough time. </p>

<p>I'm not a fan of throwing 2 hours worth of multiple choice questions at students. Sure, I could probably come up with 75 or 100 multiple choice tracing questions. Make sure there are some recursive tracings and it could easily hit 2 hours.</p>

<p>The other side though is coming up with a coding assignment that is doable in 2 hours. To do that you'd probably have a few of the upper students finishing in 15 minutes. Sort of the same issue as the discussion we had a few days ago on <a href=""https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/206/dealing-with-students-who-complete-labs-very-quickly"">students finishing labs quickly</a>. </p>

<p>I normally do a hybrid of the two, and it works okay. A multiple choice section that should take about half the period and a couple of simple coding questions for the other half. This semester I only had one student that had to stop because time was up, although a few stopped themselves early because they knew that had done well enough for the average they wanted. </p>

<p><strong>Wrong Thing:</strong> Student turns in starter code, an earlier version of their project, or the entirely wrong files.</p>

<p>I teach high school and tend to allow resubmissions when it's clear that what they turned in doesn't match up with what they're capable of. But I think part of that may be from the pressure in high schools to not fail anyone. </p>

<p>Right now I've got a third-year independent study course (high school). When I started the job a few years ago I basically just continued what the previous teacher was doing. Students propose a project during the first two weeks and then have the year to build it. The biggest catch is that there's almost no accountability for the students. </p>

<p>I'm wanting to change it into a more formal curriculum, and I'm leaning towards a languages class. These are 3rd or 4th-year students that have taken AP-A and Data Structures which are both taught in Java and may have a bit of experience with Python or JavaScript depending on the year. </p>

<p>So with that lead-in, I'm looking for some feedback on the plan.</p>

<p>We do 6, six-week grading terms. The plan is to do a different language each six-weeks. I'm leaning towards doing Python and a crash course in HTML/CSS/JS during two of the terms. And then I'm skimming 7 Languages in 7 weeks and the sequel for ideas on what other languages to do.</p>

<p>They'll have already done 2 years of Java, so I'd like to stay away from OOP and C-family languages as much as possible. </p>

<p>And I'd like it to be project heavy. Maybe one big project per language. I don't want to do many, if any, small lab type assignments. </p>

Something beginners can sink their teeth into and get results quickly. Results that are more than a ""Hello world!"" or a program that adds two integers. Something easy to use, but a thing that can guide them through the basics.</p>

<p>Phrogram (née KPL) was a good example, but it has sadly died (see pics at bottom; simple interface, simple codes, yet they look and feel like a modern programming environment and language - in small).</p>

<p>Maybe it is an existing mainstream programming language with a simplified IDE, maybe it is a full learner's solution.</p>

<p><em>Just a few ideas what to look for in a beginner's language</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Object oriented (ComLogo is funny, but has nothing to do with today's actual programming)</li>
<li>Good IDE (intellisense and built-in help)</li>
<li>Simple IDE with preferably a ""Run"" button - they can learn about translation and interpreter later (Visual Studio is amazing, but pretty intimidating for a beginner.)</li>
<li>Should be visual (commad line will never be too appealing to kids)</li>
<li>Should be free of language oddities and paradoxes (this is where most actual programming languages fail IMO)</li>
<li>The list goes on; should encourage the use of indentation, should require variable declaration, should be memory safe...</li>

From choosing textbooks to writing the College Board syllabus, I essentially started from scratch in designing my course. I'm pleased with all aspects of it as it currently stands, but there is one nagging element: the programming environment.</p>

<p>All students taking AP CS A next year have experience using Cloud9 because that's what we used for C/Python/HTML/CSS this year in AP CSP. Only in the last couple weeks did I discover how easy it is to install the JDK in a Cloud9 workspace and write, compile, and execute programs in Java from the command line. (I had read somewhere a while ago that Java and Cloud9 didn't play nicely.) I had been BlueJ all the way until that point, and I do still very much like BlueJ. However, not having taught the class before, only designed it, here's my (hopefully specific enough) question:</p>

<p><strong>Will students lose anything in their understanding of and proficiency with Java, especially in terms of the AP Exam, if the class only uses a command-line environment for program compilation and execution?</strong></p>

<p>There are many pros/cons to one IDE over another -- a topic which I think is too broad for this community. I just want to make sure, from those who have experience with this course, if there's something that the command-line environment lacks for students that an IDE like BlueJ doesn't lack. I don't want to end up doing students a disservice with respect to the objectives of the course based on this decision.</p>

<p>Edit: Cloud9 is a cloud-based IDE, which makes it ideal for my 1:1 Chromebook environment (however, I do have access to a PC lab for additional software, so that is not a restricting factor for me). As they define it, ""Cloud9 combines a powerful online code editor with a full Ubuntu workspace in the cloud."" You essentially get a text editor and a terminal for compiling and running programs. I've found that anything I can do via a Linux command line, I can do in Cloud9. It has a number of additional features that make it great for classroom use. I originally chose it because it's the environment used for the CS50 IDE. See more <a href=""https://c9.io"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

211,1,,,27/05/2017 07:32,,12,769,"<p>One of the most challenging concepts to instill in new CS students is 0-indexing (indeed, <a href=""https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/213/real-life-examples-of-0-indexing"">the pedagogy of this fact probably merits its own discussion</a>). Another difficult topic -- although a slightly more advanced one -- is pointers. (I'm thinking particularly of programming in C.) With this question I'm wondering if part of the difficulty is the syntactic sugar in C that allows the following to be equivalent:</p>
<pre><code>// declare array of 5 ints on the stack
int num[5];

// use array notation to change first element
num[0] = 42;

// use pointer arithmetic to change first element
*(num + 0) = 42;
</code></pre>
<p>With array notation, we are explicit with 0-indexing, but the logic of it isn't apparent. Yet, with pointer arithmetic, it's more clear (I think...) why we use 0: the pointer stores the base address, so dereferencing the pointer brings us to that address which is where the array logically begins.</p>
<p>Comfort with this leads to the topic of memory management on the heap with something like this:</p>
<pre><code>// declare array of 5 ints on the heap
int *num = malloc(sizeof(int) * 5);

// use pointer arithmetic to change first element
*num = 42;
</code></pre>
<p>I am toying with expanding my introduction on arrays next year to include this particular use of pointers. I recognize that it would involve taking roughly a single lesson on arrays and expanding to something closer to a week-long series to tie all of these ideas together.</p>
<p><strong>However, is it worth putting aside the syntactic sugar in order to understand more accurately the indexing of arrays?

<p>I registered for GitHub Classroom with an education account, but I haven't yet had a chance to explore its resources and would like to hear from those who have used it. I can easily collect files via our LMS or Google Classroom. I just have doubts that that method is the most efficient for either me or my students. Also, this past year, CS50 took care of the distribution code, so I didn't have to worry about that. Now I do need to consider how I can get files to students efficiently if needed. </p>

Here's a sample program I just wrote up:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
    int number = 42;
    printf(""Value of number: %d\n"", number);
    printf(""Address of number: %p\n"", &amp;number);

    int *pNumber = &amp;number;
    printf(""Value of number pointer: %p\n"", pNumber); 
    printf(""Value at address of number pointer: %d\n"", *pNumber);    
}
</code></pre>

<p>I will probably add comments before actually presenting it and making it available to students. Seeing how the address of <code>number</code> and the value of <code>pNumber</code> always correspond will hopefully reinforce how pointers work. The first and last line will match as well. The idea is to show as clear and simple an example as possible. </p>

347,1,403,,02/06/2017 06:19,,5,213,"<p>I am designing an introductory level programming class to be taught using Processing this summer. I have only four weeks and 90 minutes a day with students. Given my student demographic (middle schoolers), I am not anticipating getting much beyond the basics of the coordinate system, basic color options (stroke, fill, RGB values), variables, and loops. Since it will have more of a summer camp feel (i.e. fun, no homework), I want the approach to be engaging and hands-on. Rather than try to introduce a lot of programming concepts, I want students to have a portfolio of cool designs they have made by the time the class ends. </p>

<p>Here's the current list of projects I have slated for our four weeks:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Use three ellipses to make a Mickey Mouse silhouette (simple, but will require much iteration to perfect coordinate placement)</p></li>
<li><p>Create a basic sketch of a house (imagine those elementary school simple triangle-topped rectangles with square windows and a chimney...something like that) </p></li>
<li><p>Design a Lego family (based on <a href=""https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse120/17sp/asmts/lego_family.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this UW assignment</a>)</p></li>

  <p>Downsize homework because, like a job, students should be able to do
  the work during business hours.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I personally struggled a lot with what and how much homework to assign my AP students this past year. I wanted it to be effective and not just ""homework-for-homework's-sake.""</p>

<p>I found students worked more effectively on coding when I was in the room and they could ask for help. If they hit a brick wall at home, they were stuck until a) they got to class the next day or b) they received an email from me (presuming they took the time to send one and I got it in time to reply in a timely manner). </p>

<p>On the other hand, the content required in an AP class, especially CS50 AP, <em>seems</em> to necessitate some work be done at home. There's a lot to cover, and class minutes are at a premium, so if homework can reinforce the day's work and/or give a head start for the next day, it's worth it. Yet, as with the tweet's sentiment, I want to honor the lives of students outside of just my classroom.</p>

There is also discussion of something more efficient like merge sort. One programming assignment has students write the code in C to each of the three ""simpler"" sorting algorithms. Students get clear pseudocode of how each works, but they are left to work out the code on their own.</p>

<p>In contrast I just started working through Princeton's excellent Algorithms course on Coursera (<a href=""https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1/home"" rel=""noreferrer"">Algorithms, Part I</a>). The first unit there focused on quick find, quick union, and weighted quick union. The algorithms -- both in pseudocode and in Java -- were given by the instructor; the programming assignment (<a href=""http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Percolation</a>) involved the correct use of weighted quick union. Rather than implement it, I just had to apply it with the provided class <code>WeightedQuickUnionUF</code>.</p>

<p>Similar to the Princeton course, the AP CS A curriculum teaches sorting algorithms but only use thereof, not direct implementation (e.g. students are not expected on the exam to write insertion sort from memory). Instead, students have to understand it and be able to trace through steps in the sorting process.</p>

<p>So there seem to be two approaches here (not limited to just sorting algorithms): teaching the challenge of coding an algorithm from scratch (via implementation) vs. giving students the algorithm to apply to a particular problem (via application). </p>

<li><strong>LO 2.3.2</strong>: Use models and simulations to formulate, refine, and test hypotheses.</li>

<p>The main consensus in most compsci programs I have been at is that a sizable amount of students is inherently unable to learn how to code. <a href=""https://blog.codinghorror.com/separating-programming-sheep-from-non-programming-goats/"" rel=""noreferrer"">An old entry on Jeff Atwood's blog</a> summarizing the issue cites <a href=""http://www.eis.mdx.ac.uk/research/PhDArea/saeed/paper1.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">this 2006 article by Saeed Dehnadi and Richard Bornat</a>, claiming:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Formal logical proofs, and therefore programs – formal logical proofs that particular computations
  are possible, expressed in a formal system called a programming language – are <em>utterly meaningless</em>.
  To write a computer program you have to come to terms with this, to accept that whatever you
  might want the program to mean, the machine will blindly follow its meaningless rules and come to
  some meaningless conclusion. In the test the consistent group showed a pre-acceptance of this fact:
  they are capable of seeing mathematical calculation problems in terms of rules, and can follow those
  rules wheresoever they may lead. The inconsistent group, on the other hand, looks for meaning
  where it is not. The blank group knows that it is looking at meaninglessness, and refuses to deal
  with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It even goes on as to propose some of the prospective students to be advised away from compsci courses:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>7 Conclusion</h3>
  
  <p>There is a test for programming aptitude, or at least for success in a first programming course. We
  have speculated on the reasons for its success, but in truth we don’t understand how it works any
  more than you do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today, I found a <a href=""http://www.eis.mdx.ac.uk/staffpages/r_bornat/papers/camel_hump_retraction.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">retraction from Richard Bonat</a>, claiming his conclusions were affected by his mental health issues:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>2 How it happened</h3>
  
  <p>Though it’s embarrassing, I feel it’s necessary to explain how and why I came to write “The camel has two
  humps” and its part-retraction in (Bornat et al., 2008). It’s in part a mental health story.</p>
  
  <p>In autumn 2005 I became clinically depressed. My physician put me on the then-standard treatment for
  depression, an SSRI. But she wasn’t aware that for some people an SSRI doesn’t gently treat depression,
  it puts them on the ceiling. I took the SSRI for three months, by which time I was grandiose, extremely
  self-righteous and very combative – myself turned up to one hundred and eleven. I did a number of very
  silly things whilst on the SSRI and some more in the immediate aftermath, amongst them writing “The
  camel has two humps”. I’m fairly sure that I believed, at the time, that there were people who couldn’t learn
  to program and that Dehnadi had proved it. The paper doesn’t exactly make that claim, but it comes pretty
  close. Perhaps I wanted to believe it because it would explain why I’d so often failed to teach them. It was
  an absurd claim because I didn’t have the extraordinary evidence needed to support it. I no longer believe
  it’s true.</p>

<h1>Question</h1>

<p>I've been a TA for compsci courses in three colleges and, in all of them, <em>transparency</em> was a core value: past exams, classes, and <strong>grades</strong> were made available from the very beginning. Failure rates were never lower than 30%, often beating failure rates for subjects widely regarded as more difficult, such as physics or calculus. </p>

<p>On the one hand, some students might feel discouraged to put in the effort to learn knowing that they have a high likelihood of failing. On the other hand, it might be beneficial for them to know hiccups are expected and perhaps compsci might not be the way for them.</p>

<p>My questions are: do students benefit from knowing most of them will likely fail the subject? Should they be informed that there might be a high chance they won't advance past CS101?</p>

2903,1,2904,,24/07/2017 11:22,,18,1991,"<p>This year I'll be an unofficial teacher assistant in the CS class of 9th graders.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>This question is about a curriculum for introducing students to programming in java.</p>
<p>The students are in 9th grade (14-15 years old) and are not expected to have any background whatsoever in computer science (usually some do have, but that's not relevant to the curriculum. Differentiating it is something relatively easy at this stage).</p>
<p>This curriculum spans 2 terms (1 year - Sept. to June), and is meant to build a firm foundation for students. The subject is compulsory in 9th grade. I have some doubts regarding the ordering of the subjects in the curriculum.</p>
<h2>How it stands</h2>
<p>Students are initially introduced to computers in general.</p>
<p>The first lesson is always brainstorming: <em>&quot;What is computer science?&quot;</em>. It's established from there that programming (&quot;computer science is writing code&quot; is usually a response of a few students) is writing something, and then converting it into binary (it's expected that they know that the binary numbering system <em>exists</em>). The students use the remaining time (<span class=""math-container"">$\pm$</span>10 minutes) to write the famous:</p>
<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args){ //we don't explain this line
    System.out.println(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); //sometimes we use a Hebrew alternative:
    System.out.println(&quot;!שלום, עולם&quot;);//which is literally the translation
}
</code></pre>
<p>That's the first lesson. From here, I'll list the subjects (each one is a subject, and not a separate lesson; lessons are ignored, I only address the subjects of the curriculum) taught (the language used to teach is Java)</p>
<p>   0. (First Lesson) introduction and simple printing of text</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Simple Eclipse console Input\Output and user input (print what the user inputs etc.) as well as variables (just primitives, and just <code>int</code>,<code>double</code>,<code>char</code> and <code>String</code>).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Mathematical operators: <code>+</code>,<code>-</code>,<code>*</code>,<code>/</code> as well as <code>%</code>. The curriculum has an option to teach increment  as well as <code>+=</code>, <code>-=</code> and the rest.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Conditionals: <code>if</code>, <code>if\else</code> and nested <code>if</code>s. Also <code>boolean</code> is introduced.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>switch-case</code>. Not much to say about this at this level.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Math</code> library. This is one of the things that caused me to doubt the order of things in the curriculum.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>for</code> loops and various uses. Arrays are not taught in the curriculum <strong>at all</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p><code>while</code> loops.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Nested loops.</p>
</li>
<li><p>functions. yes, functions:</p>
<pre><code>static returnType functionName ( parameters)
{
    //operations
    return returnValue;
}
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it.</p>
<h2>Doubts</h2>
<p>I spotted a few issues in the curriculum. First and foremost: Where are all the arrays? I want to include arrays, but I'm not sure where\instead of what.</p>
<p>Teaching <code>for</code> after arrays seems better than before, because then I can show the <code>foreach</code> in the same lesson. They are essentially the same (but not 100% equivalent. Concurrent modifications is something beginners aren't ready for). So I am uncertain about the order of the subjects.</p>
<p>Secondly: Functions. Again, why? I want to remove them from the curriculum (students learn about them in the following years anyway, as part of OOP), but this might do more damage than good. Students might want to know, after an entire year, what <em>exactly</em> is the meaning of the <code>public <strong>static</strong> <em>void</em> <em><strong>main</strong></em></code> from lesson 1.</p>
<p>Functions can explain that, but other than that, it's pointless at this stage (because they'll learn it anyway, should they major in CS).</p>
<p>So, does the order of subjects in the curriculum, as it stands, make sense (keeping in mind that arrays are not covered at all)?</p>
<p>Note: this question is not a duplicate of <a href=""https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/2793"">this one</a>, simply because I already have a curriculum, and I am asking for a review of it. I'm also asking about specific aspects of my curriculum, and not general &quot;hand wave-ish&quot; things.</p>

2953,1,,,26/07/2017 08:04,,5,1052,"<p>After learning recursion in class, students take a test (a few lessons for teaching the subject, and then a test), and are then given a grade. The test is on paper, and I can't change that fact.<br>
All tests are written on paper, but the questions on the test are subject to changes, and those are the changes being asked about.</p>

<p>These students are in a CS major in High School.</p>

<p>Besides asking them to write recursive functions for a variety of purposes (tree traversal\search etc.), their knowledge is also tested by asking them to trace by hand (on paper, without a computer) a given recursive function (usually one that does string manipulations).</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>public static int permutation(String prefix, String str){
    int n = str.length();
    if (n == 0) {
        System.out.println(prefix);
        return 1;
    }
    else {
        int sum=0;
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
            sum+=permutation(prefix + str.charAt(i), str.substring(0, i) + str.substring(i+1, n));
        return sum;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and it is called in some <code>main</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(permutation("""", ""abcde""));
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example for how their tracing should look like (this image is not related to the permutation example above, but it serves to explain how they trace the recursion)</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/FwMn5.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/FwMn5.png"" alt=""recursive tracing""></a></p>

<p>They essentially trace the call stack (and they know this; they know that effectively that's what they are doing).</p>

<p>However, I have some doubts about this method of testing (specifically the tracing).</p>

<p>So, would testing students like this be useful? By that I mean: does it actually indicate understanding of recursion and\or increase their ability to understand recursive functions they see?</p>

<p>If not, then how else can their knowledge of recursion be tested in a written test?</p>

<p>The tests are given because that's how the students are taught:</p>

<ul>
<li>They study a subject (in this case, recursion)</li>
<li>they are tested on that subject.</li>
</ul>

<p>There's no bigger goal, no project that they use it in (yet). They learn it because it's part of the curriculum.</p>

<p><strong>Clarification</strong></p>

<p>My question isn't about teaching recursion, nor is it about the specific example I gave. It's about whether the described test method (on an exam) would actually be able to test the students' knowledge about recursion.</p>

<p>Currently, students in 11th grade at my school are required in tests to write functions that should preform some operation (usually operations on data structures like <code>LinkedList</code>, <code>Stack</code> and <code>Queue</code>). </p>

<p>This works fairly well in terms of checking whether a student knows how to use those data structures. </p>

<p>However, it's not uncommon to see an answer that does, eventually, preform the required operation; and yet its complexity is $O(n^3)$ (no kidding. The specific case I'm thinking of is one where the student worked with the unsorted linked list of stacks<sup>1</sup> in 3 nested for loops). </p>

<p>In this specific lab, they idea is for them to see:</p>

<p>$$y(t_{n+1})=y(t_n)+\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta t}\Delta t\approx y(t_n)+v(t_n)\,(t_{n+1}-t_n)$$
with
$$v(t_{n+1})\approx v(t_n)+g*(t_{n+1}-t_n)$$</p>

<p>and then run over times $\{t_i\}_{i=1}^n$ and see that the $y$ values they get are the same as:</p>

<p>$$y(t_n)\approx y(t_1)+v(t_1)\,t_n+\frac{1}{2}g\,t_n^2$$</p>

<p>However, because they use <code>float</code>, they get rounding errors when dealing with small time differences ($\Delta t$). I don't want to get into the whole floating point arithmetics field, because they won't understand that (the word ""exponent"" would frighten them, to say the least). </p>

<p>On the other hand, if they use <code>double</code>, then the rounding errors wouldn't be significant (because they aren't dealing with $\Delta t \le 10^{-5}$ of a second). So I try to explain that they should use <code>double</code>, but just stating it as a ""rule of thumb"" isn't a good idea (because there <strong>are</strong> cases where one would prefer <code>float</code>)</p>

<p>So, what explanation, as to why they should use <code>double</code> for these things, would be compelling? </p>

<p>Better yet, is there any way I can <strong>show</strong> the students such an explanation? (Perhaps an online, interactive demonstration of floating point precision etc. - I couldn't find one)</p>

4374,1,4378,,25/02/2018 20:32,,6,747,"<p>I started teaching NodeJS to some of the students in the computer science major at my school (these students know the basics of Java and OOP).</p>

<p>The idea is for them to make a small web project (such as a grades and averages calculator or a display for a timetable etc.) using javascript.</p>

<p>I plan to teach about javascript, client-server separation, http requests etc. The main problem is the vast number of JS libraries in existence. I intend to emphasize that <strong>most of the code is already written</strong>. E.g. the code for creating nice graphs exists in charts-js, and responsive client side frameworks (angular, react) exist. </p>

<p>This project is also meant to teach the notion that programmers rarely write programs from scratch, and that they should often see if there exists a library\framework that give a functionality they need. </p>

<p>However, with Javascript, the vast number of libraries makes it somewhat difficult to know which ones to pick. It's not impossible, but I'd rather students not waste time on that. </p>

<p>I ran this by a handful of students, to see whether students actually get overwhelmed. From what I saw, students are likely to waste time reading up about the library they are checking (somewhat like reading a review for a PC before buying it). Research is great, but the amount of wasted time was quite big. </p>

<p>So, what can I do to teach them how to ""sniff"" the ""correct"" library more efficiently? In other words, how can I teach them which metrics are significant (and <em>why</em> those metrics are important) when deciding whether a library is useful? Bearing in mind that the time it takes is to be considered, I'd prefer ways and metrics that are generally faster (e.g. reading up the documentation of a library is somewhat slower when compared to checking npm's download in the last day)</p>

4712,1,4713,,06/05/2018 10:53,,3,130,"<p>I was recently asked to teach someone OOP and C++, to a relatively advanced level in the former and an intermediate level in the latter.</p>

<p>After one half of a private lesson, it became clear that the student isn't good at learning in this way. Instead, I tried to give the student some links to explanations and examples (mainly so that the student could learn the remainder of that lesson's material).</p>

<p>That proved to be so effective. </p>

<p>For the next lesson, I won't ""bother"" with teaching the student. I've found a satisfactory collection of websites that cover the relevant material for the lesson, but I am at a loss on how to order them (and, indeed, the curriculum in the broader sense).</p>

<p>This made me think of the following:</p>

<p>There are probably many students that learn from websites and links etc. much more effectively, as opposed to learning in a classroom (mostly self-learners)</p>

<p>So my question is how can a teacher (or student) find resources that both cover the material, provide example and exercise and are ordered in synergy?</p>

<p>Specifically, OOP and C++ each have many subjects and points of interest that are built on one another. For complex subjects/paradigms, it is much harder to find fitting resources. So the methods (for constructing a curriculum built upon resources and websites as detailed above) I am looking for should be able to tackle such a complex combination, meant for less than 5 students.</p>

<p>The students are gifted (not a prerequisite, but most of them are) highschoolers with either no background in programming, or very little background. </p>

<p>The purpose is to interest them in learning programming. More specifically, to give them a taste of some aspects of various languages, hoping that each will find something they like and, being naturally curious, they might pursue the subjects they liked a bit more.</p>

<p>The curriculum I have in mind is more or less:</p>

<ol>
<li>Using <code>C</code>: 

<ul>
<li>Intro to the simplest of things</li>
<li><code>printf(""Hello World!\n"");</code> and the like</li>
<li>most importantly, <strong>introduction to types</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Using <code>C++</code>/<code>Java</code>:

<ul>
<li>very brief overview of OOP, just at the concept level</li>
<li>""Things"" are described in <code>class</code>es which have properties etc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>Using <code>JavaScript</code>:

<ul>
<li>Intro to functional programming. Again, just at the concept level</li>
<li>""Things"" are described with functions.  </li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>and finally:</p>

<ol start=""4"">
<li>Using <code>python</code>:

<ul>
<li>finish with small tasks for them to get some hands on experience and things to show their friends</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>As I see it, the main issue is, for lack of a better word, <em>synergy</em>. Subjects 2 and 3 seem highly disconnected. Moreover, I fear that for the students, the things they learnt in <code>C</code> and <code>C++</code> will seem ""pointless"", since most of them will think that they don't use those concepts and ideas in the tasks in part 4. </p>

<p>How might I bridge between OOP in Java or C++, with functional programming in JavaScript? Personally, I thought using Java's functional interfaces could work, but that would require teaching about interfaces, making the course far less ""shallow"" than it should be. </p>

<p>Might there be a simple or neat ""trick"" to connect the two subjects?</p>

<p>I am looking for a better way to explain viruses or a better metaphor than the biological virus. The problem with a biological virus as a metaphor is that if we follow it to its logical conclusion, then if there is even the slightest problem in the metaphor, it will interfere with students reasoning down the line, which could lead to false conclusions and confusion.</p>

<p>When I was at university in (1991), we were told some simple rules for the computer lab:</p>

<ul>
<li>No drinking or eating in the lab.</li>
<li>Don't hit the computers, poke anything into them, or try to take them apart.</li>
<li>Don't switch them off (someone else may be using it).</li>
<li>Don't worry, <strong>if you tell it to do something and it breaks then it is our fault not yours</strong>. Our job is to keep them from breaking, we do this by using good quality software. These is security to stop you from breaking it for any one else. If you break it for you, then come and see us, and we will fix it. If you break the security, and we encourage you to try, then do not do anything malicious as this is immoral and criminal, just come and see us and tell us, so we can fix the software bug, and give you your prize.</li>
</ul>

<p>We are now telling students that they can easily break the computer by clicking the wrong button. This includes infecting a computer with a virus.</p>

<p>I am not happy with the normal descriptions of a virus, as these put all of the blame onto the virus writers, and all of the responsibility onto the user/children.</p>

<h2>Some descriptions that I have seen.</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/computer-virus.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">“each requiring a different cure”</a>
Why? There are thousands of viruses, but only a small number of vulnerabilities. Viruses take advantage of vulnerabilities. Would it not be easier to fix the vulnerabilities.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/zcmbgk7"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">“prevention better than cure”</a> (true). But goes on about how a virus scanner can check programs before you run them. This is putting the blame on to the viruses, and the responsibility on to the children.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Teachers often deal with this by doing a lesson in the computer room, using MS-Word; Using I-Pads, or searching for stuff with Google. This is the “we have to use a computer” panic. But it is not very educational</p>

<p>This has not always gone well: often a negative or neutral impact on computing, and if to much pressure is put on teachers to do this, then also a negative affect on the other subject as well. This is because most teachers are not computer science or IT teachers (I have heard some say “the pupils know more than I do”).</p>

<p>So what can be done in other subjects, not to just use computers or to try to give experience of computers to the pupils, but to teach an aspect of computer science or IT whilst still remaining within their subject's specialty. In particular, what can we do to help in this process? For example: how to aid with computational thinking in other disciplines. Can this be done in such a way as to also aid our own students? </p>

3573,1,3600,,10/09/2017 14:34,,9,244,"<p>We are often asked to plan: We are asked to make lesson plans; When I was a programmer sometimes I was asked to create a plan; We are told to ask our students to plan their projects.</p>

<p>However there is often a problem with this:</p>

<ul>
<li>As a programmer,
I could not plan everything upfront. There is a lot of discovery in the development process. If we knew what we were doing then it was because we had done it before. If we had done it before, then it was a bug that we were doing it again (we should be reusing).</li>
<li>As a student,
I have been in a class room where a teacher has told students to plan / design a project, and that then after that they would be taught how to program it. This often does not go well, as students can not plan for something that they have no experience of.
Teachers seem to think that this is the “Correct way to do it”.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another approach is test driven development: Ask what next, Write <strong>simplest</strong> test that will fail, Write <strong>simplest</strong> code that will make test pass, re-factor if needed, repeat. This works most of the time. However, there are times when it does not. For example, the other day I was making an adding machine out of lego (my own design). Part of the build was tinkering and experimenting, but for part I stopped and wrote a plan. It was easier to plan on paper than as I went along, as mistakes could be fixed more easily (it is hard to fix an error in the middle of a lego model, you have to take it apart).</p>

<p>I seem to have an intuitive feel for planning (just enough, and just in time). However this is probably not a good explanation to tell others.</p>

<p>When students are doing project work,
When is planning and high-level design a good idea? When is it not? How do you tell the difference? And how do you teach this to the students?</p>

There is an article on teaching <code>goto</code>. The author states that there is value in teaching <code>goto</code>, as it helps to translate flowcharts into code.</p>

<p>I have always considered <code>goto</code> to be harmful. It results in code that is buggy and hard to read. Not just because I read it in a 1960 paper “Go To Statement Considered Harmful“ — Edsger W. Dijkstra, but because it is self evident (once you have tried structured-programming).</p>

<p>I have always considered flow-charts the same way. They are just the pictorial form of unstructured code (The UML of assembly language).</p>

<p>So the question:</p>

<p>Does the author have a point? Is there some value in <code>goto</code> or flow-charts?</p>

<li>Flowcharts are visual, but there are visual structured representations that are better.</li>

<p>I also think a lot of other teachers struggle with this. I have heard teachers saying “We don't do that any more. No we don't do ICT any more.” or “Isn't it a shame that we don't do that any more, now that there is no ICT.”. In a lot of instances I think that what they are talking about would be IT or Digital literacy, under the new scheme.</p>

<p>There are other cases, where I see teachers planning to teach computer art, and wonder is this not art? (A lot of this could be leftover from the ICT days.)</p>

They often have to follow lengthy instructions, that I print on paper, of mostly screen snips (So this also takes a long time to prepare).</p>
<p>What can I do to make this easier for pupils?</p>
<h2>For example</h2>
<p>I have had a lesson where I have had detailed instructions on setting up Python/Idle: Starting the editor, finding starter code, they contain many screen shots. This took me a long time to prepare, and is not easy for the pupils. They are not productive at the start of the lesson, and get demotivated.</p>
<p>They need to get to:</p>
<ul>
<li>starter code copied to there personal folder.</li>
<li>idle started and on one side of the screen.</li>
<li>code loaded into idle.</li>
<li>code run.</li>
<li>output window on other side of screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Common errors:</p>
<ul>
<li>running code without idle (so they can not edit it).</li>
<li>running my copy of the code (so they can not edit it).</li>
<li>overlapping windows (so they are frustrated that they can not see, and spend a lot of time moving windows). (This one can be solved with better digital literacy, at the start, or a bit at the start of each lesson.)</li>
</ul>
<p>I have had the same problems when teaching spreadsheets, and am anticipating it with web design. I was hoping to use the brackets editor. The start state would be.</p>

That typing a program, and then immediately running it, is not immediate enough. Output should change as code changes, not wait for us to press run.

<p>The problem is with “virtual memory”: </p>

<p>Some of the teaching resources correctly use the phrase virtual memory, and physical memory, and describe how virtual is mapped to physical via the memory management unit.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/q8hHr.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/q8hHr.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a> from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory</a></p>

<p>The computer's operating system, using a combination of hardware and software, maps memory addresses used by a program, called virtual addresses, into physical addresses in computer memory. Main storage, as seen by a process or task, appears as a contiguous address space or collection of contiguous segments. The operating system manages virtual address spaces and the assignment of real memory to virtual memory. Address translation hardware in the CPU, often referred to as a memory management unit or MMU, automatically translates virtual addresses to physical addresses. Software within the operating system may extend these capabilities to provide a virtual address space that can exceed the capacity of real memory and thus reference more memory than is physically present in the computer.</p>

<p>While in other resources they use the phrase “virtual memory”, and describe “paging”. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Virtual memory is a section of volatile memory created temporarily on
  the storage drive. It is created when a computer is running many
  processes at once and RAM is running low.</p>
  
  <p>The operating system makes part of the storage drive available to use
  as RAM. Virtual memory is much slower than main memory because
  processing power is being taken up by moving data around, rather than
  just executing instructions. The guide on operating systems explains
  how the OS manages memory.</p>

I have noticed that pupils often select no, even though I spend a considerable time, telling them to save often, to save when prompted, etc. There was a study that showed that when experts see a save prompt pop up it MS-word, they click <code>yes</code> without even reading it. However when a novice sees one, they read it 20 times, then click <code>no</code> (thus loosing there work). When asked the novices said, that the computer was asking permission, so it must be something dangerous.</p></li>

<li><p>Not letting us delete something that has a error.

The work around is often unintuitive.
Or half adding a field to a table, it will not let you do anything until it is complete. Pupils see their error, and try to delete the field, but this is something and it is not allowed, until they finish. I have to tell them to set it to something random, then delete it.

<h1>An argument for the 2nd one</h1>
<p>I think the 2nd program is more elegant: it has less repeated code.</p>
<p>note: when I wrote this I copied the 1st line into the other 2 places, then when I tested it I discovered that I missed the closing <code>&quot;</code>, so had to fix it 3 times. This is an example of why repeated code is a problem, when a program needs re-editing. In the second version, the only repeated code is <code>&quot;yes&quot;</code>, so still some room for improvement.</p>

<p>My response is typically:</p>

<ul>
<li>We are learning recursion since reducing problems into smaller problems is a key skill, and recursion is just an example of reducing a problem to a self-similar smaller problem.</li>
<li>Also, no, recursion not universally better design. Often, calling functions repeatedly like this wastes space on the stack and the implementation can be much less efficient. Our recursive formulation of factorial for example, is a terrible design. Unless you know the recursion depth is bound by something small (think: logarithmic) and resultant implementation is much simpler, then its not worth it.</li>

<p>Students seem deflated with that response. Why learn something that is not very practical, or is often inefficient? Why learn something that is 'sometimes simpler' when (to them) it seems actually like a counter-intuitive design?</p>

<p>My question(s): how do I get students excited about recursion? How do I better motivate studying recursion? Can I better / more naturally express those conditions under which (or those languages for which) recursion is not a poor design choice?</p>

<p>This is challenging once you accept that CS1 students likely: know nothing about functional languages, where recursion is more natural; don't know anything about side-effect free design or mathematical proofs of correctness; are not using recursive data structures yet; etc. It feels like the 'benefits' of recursion are hard to express to a CS0/CS1 audience.</p>

2933,1,,,25/07/2017 00:20,,13,509,"<p>I'm currently preparing to teach a course on data structures and algorithms. In my past experiences helping teach similar courses, I've noticed that many students find it challenging to ""hold multiple layers of abstraction"" in their head. This problem manifests in several different ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>Students find it challenging to transition from working on assignments where they need to implement only one or two classes to larger projects involving multiple, interlocking classes.</li>
<li>Students find it challenging to understand in full detail how more complex data structures work.</li>
</ul>

<p>To help make this more concrete, I'll pick a specific lesson/assignment I'm developing: having students implement a hashmap with separate chaining as a part of a larger project (in Java).</p>

<p>In order to successfully implement just the hashmap, students need to understand that the hashmap has several different ""layers"" of abstraction.</p>

<ol>
<li>The Map abstract data type (ADT): in particular, understanding the difference between the ADT and this particular implementation.</li>
<li>The key: understand what it means for a key to be hashable (both in general and within Java).</li>
<li>The hashmap internals: understanding what we do with hashed keys, resizing strategies, etc.</li>
<li>The chain: Understand that the chain can again be abstracted (we can use any map other then a hashmap for the chain).</li>
</ol>

<p>And of course, once they're done, students need to successfully use the data structures they've written to complete some other task which might have even more layers of abstraction.</p>

<p>Ideally, I want students to develop the ability to selectively ""abstract"" and ignore different parts of a project when implementing something to reduce mental overhead. Some students seem to intuitively grok this idea but others instead try and hold the entire data structure (or project!) in their head, have a compulsive need to read <em>all</em> instructor provided code, etc, and quickly become overwhelmed. </p>

<p>In this particular case, I've observed students seem prone to becoming confused by where the hashing logic lives, or losing sight of what the map ADT is asking them to implement in the first place.</p>

<p>Some of this is certainly solvable by just explaining hashmap more effectively, but my core question is this: <strong>What are some strategies for helping students become more comfortable working with multiple layers of abstraction? How can I help students develop the meta-skill of being comfortable with abstraction?</strong></p>

<p>I'd welcome answers discuss potential strategies in context of this hashmap example as well as answers that address the more general question.</p>

3208,1,,,11/08/2017 15:43,,9,368,"<p>One common concern many independent learners of computer science and tech have is figuring out what they ""don't know"". More specifically, the concern is that since they've never been formally educated in CS, their knowledge might have ""blind spots"", which can cripple them when they start working on more complex projects or try and get a job. (For example, somebody who didn't know that data structures and algorithms were a thing will very likely struggle on most standard tech interviews).</p>

<p>I interact with/help self-learners on a fairly regular basis, and am never quite sure what to tell them when this question comes up. </p>

<p>One strategy, of course, is to simply give them a list of things they ought to know -- there are many articles that give a good overview of topics covered by a standard CS degree, for example (<a href=""http://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/"" rel=""noreferrer"">example 1</a>, <a href=""https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science"" rel=""noreferrer"">example 2</a>). However, this strategy doesn't generalize well: once you move on to trying to learn about something not on some list, you're back at square one.</p>

<p>The other strategy I try suggesting is to just read random highly-upvoted posts on StackOverflow and news aggregate sites like Hacker News -- I've personally found you tend to pick up a good awareness of different CS and tech topics almost by osmosis if you do this. However, this strategy is also flawed: it's a random and slow process, and isn't guaranteed to be comprehensive. (If a topic isn't trendy, it's likely you'll never stumble across it.)</p>

<p>This brings me to my core question: <strong>what are some effective meta-strategies suitable for self-learners that help them identify gaps in their knowledge?</strong> </p>

3223,1,,,13/08/2017 18:40,,10,219,"<p>Bootcamps have become an increasingly popular alternative for starting or transitioning to a career in tech over the past 5 years or so. As a result, a common question I get when interacting with beginners is whether bootcamps are indeed worth it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, after conducting some preliminary research myself, I found it challenging to find hard data that supports a conclusion either way. Most online sources (such as <a href=""https://www.coursereport.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">coursereport.com</a>) seem very marketing-y and don't seem to analyze the more existential question of whether bootcamps are a good idea in the first place, compared to other options. And of course, there are plenty of anecdotes, but anecdotes are not data.</p>

<p>Analyzing this situation is complicated by several other factors:</p>

<ol>
<li>Bootcamps may be suitable for some, but not all: for example, professionals with an unrelated degree trying to <em>transition</em> to tech vs high school graduates trying to <em>enter</em> tech.</li>
<li>The quality of individual bootcamps can vary wildly (but then again, I suspect, though cannot confirm, the quality of university CS degrees can also vary just as wildly).</li>
<li>Bootcamps are incentivized to report skewed data. Even something as simple as ""% of people who graduate with a job"" can be complicated. (If the bootcamp hires you back as a TA, does that count? What if you get a job in a non-tech field? What if you get a job after a year of additional self-study?).</li>
</ol>

<p>This brings me to my core question: <strong>What research has been conducted so far regarding how effective bootcamps are at helping their attendees obtain a full-time job in tech in a timely manner?</strong></p>

<p>For this question, we can assume that the bootcamp attendees are people who either have completed a degree in an unrelated major and want to switch careers, or are people who are unable to attend a university for one reason or another.</p>

<p>An ideal answer would be links + summaries to reports that conduct a careful, measured, and data-driven analysis and seem to take into consideration factors like the ones I listed up above. I would prefer papers that have been accepted by a reputable, peer-reviewed academic journals or conferences if at all possible. </p>

<p>A nice bonus would be if the reports compared bootcamp success rates to other methods of switching careers (for example, getting a second degree or simply self-studying), but this isn't necessary.</p>

<p>For example, here is <a href=""http://www.kylethayer.com/assets/papers/BarriersFacedByCodingBootcampStudents-Thayer-Ko.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">one paper</a> that satisfies the above requirements. It'll apparently be presented at the upcoming <a href=""https://icer.hosting.acm.org/icer-2017/schedule/"" rel=""noreferrer"">ACM ICER conference</a> later this month and draws some interesting conclusions -- the paper's main limitation is its relatively small datasize (it tracks only 26 students within a specific geographical location IIRC).</p>

3228,1,,,14/08/2017 20:08,,17,1593,"<p>A common problem I've noticed many beginners (especially self-taught ones) run into is figuring out how to transition from working through tutorials and exercises to working on full-fledged projects.

<p>One way to make it over this ""cliff"" is to find a teacher that can help guide you through progressively more challenging projects. Of course, this isn't a path available to self-learners by definition.</p>

<p>The next best alternative is probably to find a tutorial or online course that does something similar. Unfortunately, these resources either appear to be hard to find or simply inadequate (?), based on my (anecdotal) experiences answering beginner questions on another forum.</p>

<p>Taking all this into mind: <strong>What concrete advice would you give to self-learners who are struggling to transition to working on larger projects?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> To answer @BlackJack's question: by ""larger project"", I mean a project that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does not immediately follow from a tutorial or exercise: finishing the project requires a fair degree of independent work. </li>
<li>Is ""large"" and ""challenging"" relative to the expectations and abilities of a beginner -- for example, it might take a beginner a few weeks to complete a ""large project"", but an experienced programmer might be able to pull off the same thing in a weekend.</li>
<li>Is not a ""single-file project"": there are lots of things you need to do and lots of details to keep track of.</li>
<li>At the very end of the scale, a ""large project"" might be the sort of thing an intern or an entry-level junior developer is asked to do. (Most beginners will probably likely need to complete multiple easier projects first before they're at this level, though.)</li>

3491,1,,,05/09/2017 00:57,,9,966,"<p>Something I've often observed is that many students find it challenging to figure out how to use full-fledged IDEs such as Eclipse, Netbeans, Visual Studios, IntelliJ, and PyCharm.</p>

<p>From what I can tell, this is due to a variety of factors:</p>

<ol>
<li>The UI is often visually complex and intimidating for beginners. This is exacerbated in cases where your IDE unexpectedly changes appearance (for example, after running anything in Eclipse).</li>
<li>Setting up new projects and running even a simple ""hello world"" program is often non-trivial (you have to pick between several different ""project templates"", need to adapt to working in this new folder layout, sometimes need to configure your IDE to point to your compiler or editor...)</li>
<li>The IDE can sometimes be unexpectedly initially laggy. For example, IntelliJ will need to ""index"" your files/your standard library (with minimal visual cues that this process is taking place). This will cause functionality to be mysteriously laggy or missing for about a minute after first using your IDE.</li>
<li>The IDE often introduces several new ""metaphors"" that need to be explained. (For example, Eclipse has this notion of a ""workspace"" -- it's not immediately obvious this is actually a folder on your filesystem). This problem is further exacerbated by the fact that a small minority of students don't seem to have a firm grasp of what a filesystem is (which is disconcerting).</li>
<li>It's easy to accidentally screw up the appearance of your IDE. If you accidentally click a small button or drag-and-drop something by accident, you can remove an essential part of your view without an obvious way of getting it back.</li>
</ol>

<p>In light of these factors (and other ones I may have missed), <strong>what is the best way to help students adapt to using IDEs?</strong></p>

<p>I briefly thought about demoing how to install and use an IDE in class, but that seemed like a poor use of class time. My current idea is to provide handouts guiding students through their installation process, but I'm curious to see if there are more creative or effective solutions other people have come up with.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this question, we can assume students have completed at least CS 1, maybe CS 2, and have prior experience using either a text editor or a minimal IDE (such as BlueJ or JGrasp). I'd welcome both language-specific and language-agnostic answers.</p>

<p>One of the skills we'd like students to be able to acquire is the ability to translate English into equivalent regular expressions -- e.g. translate phrases like ""match all strings containing an even number of the character 'a'"" or ""match all binary strings that do not contain the string '1001'"".</p>

<p>Some students seem to easily pick up the ""knack"" of performing these sorts of translations, but many more of them seem to struggle.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I'm not sure how to best help these students. Constructing regular expressions isn't usually something I find particularly difficult, so I've been finding it difficult to ""get into the mindset"" of the students who find writing regular expressions to be less obvious. </p>

<p>I've spent some time introspecting and trying to pick apart what strategies I subconsciously tend to use when faced with a new problem, but that's mostly yielded a list of ad-hoc strategies rather then anything fundamental.</p>

<hr>

<p>Something I feel I should note is that I don't think unfamiliarity with syntax is likely to be the culprit. We're starting by studying specifically regular expressions (not regex) and have restricted ourselves to using a very minimal toolset: union, concatenation, the Kleene star, and epsilons -- so, no backreferences, no captures, nothing like that. </p>

<p>Rather, it seems what students find most difficult is the inherent act of interpreting and translating an English sentence and formalizing it into some logical form.</p>

<p>I've seen this same sort difficulty of manifest appear in other scenarios: for example, earlier this quarter, we asked students to translate English into propositional or predicate logic: I also found it difficult to teach students how to do this in any kind of systematic way. As another example, in other courses, I've observed many students find it challenging to translate English into SQL queries (and here I have some more sympathy, since I also find constructing certain kinds of SQL queries to be challenging).</p>

<p>The best I've been able to do so far is just have students do a bunch of practice/walk through a bunch of examples, but that doesn't strike me as being a particularly efficient strategy (though I don't dispute that practice is essential).</p>

4232,1,,,23/01/2018 08:32,,5,200,"<p>I'm currently preparing a unit on the implementation of hash tables for a data structures and algorithms course (this is a university-level class if it matters).</p>
<p>Specifically, I'm focusing on preparing a lecture on different collision resolution strategies, focusing mainly on separate chaining, linear probing, quadratic probing, and double hashing.</p>
<p>My question is this: <strong>why do we teach quadratic probing at all?</strong></p>
<p>I initially added quadratic probing to my todo list mainly because previous instructors of my course taught it and because it's listed in several textbooks I consulted (<em>Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java</em> by Weiss, and <em>Introduction to Algorithms</em> by Cormen, et. al.)</p>
<p>However, I'm not really seeing the pedagogical value of doing so. While it's true that it does offer some minor theoretical speedups over linear probing which I suppose might be interesting to discuss, I don't think those speedups are actually &quot;good enough&quot; to be used in the wild (especially once you take into account things like cache locality, which can sometimes make linear probing surprisingly competitive).</p>
<p>Based on my (admitted informal and ad-hoc) survey of hash table implementations in popular programming languages, people seem to either use separate chaining (Java and C# (sort of)), double hashing (GCC's C++ stdlib implementation), or a linear congruential PRNG (Python).</p>
<p>In that case, is it worth bringing it up at all? I wouldn't mind covering it if I could use it as a vehicle to teach some more general CS concept in some way, or if it had interesting theoretical properties worth exploring, even if only briefly, but at the moment, it just doesn't seem worth the class time.</p>
<p>I suppose at best, I could use it as a stepping stone to bridge the gap between linear probing and some slightly more complicated technique, such as double hashing, but that's all I can think of.</p>
<p>Is there something I'm missing?</p>

In my school board at least, it is still very grey what exactly to teach in AP CS. Essentially this is a grade 12 course continuing from grade 11 (which taught variables, arrays, loops, functions and simple inheritance). The goal of AP as posed to regular is to focus more on OOP, specifically SOLID principles.</p>

<p>With that out of the way, here's the situation. I am teaching a summer course to high school students who want an enriched Computer Science course in order to succeed in University. This is the first time this course is offered during the summer (and my first time teaching this course). This week, I decided to go over some review of Java basics to gauge the overall knowledge of my class. Ironically enough, everyone seemed to know variables and access modifiers, but as I began going over some Inheritance, students became confused over static variables, static space and where variables were.</p>

<p>I drew out a simple memory model and showed where static, heap, stack and meta-space. I could already tell there were a lot of blank faces <em>(okay, let's back track)</em>. I essentially explained that things declared in the static space are global to the project and belong to a class as posed to instances. However, surprise surprise, I spent majority of this week helping students with ""non static variable cannot be referenced in a static context"". </p>

<p>For the rest of the term, I am wondering if I should devote a week to thoroughly explaining what exactly the static keyword means, what static space is and the Java memory model, or continue with the material (as there is a lot to cover) and just try to stray away from involving static space and variables in my examples?</p>

<p>What mental models of memory storage in general (and for sequences in particular) are typical in students who learn Python first vs. students who learn another language first- one that treats arrays more like C does?</p>

<p>Python has particular elements that do not correspond well to Java, however.

<p>Python's native types don't include a type in which pointer arithmetic can be exploited for speed, though the <code>numpy</code> library offers an array. I suspect that when students learn about Java arrays, they probably build a mental model that fairly closely matches how arrays are stored in memory in C. Python does not actually store lists in a sequence of equally sized memory blocks; <code>[3, 'a', 5.2]</code> is a perfectly valid list. </p>

The PLTW curriculum uses a ""Natural Language"" module of RobotC that includes wait-until functions like <code>waitUntilDistanceSensorLessThan(200)</code>, but these cause the robot to be incapable of responding to input during the wait-until statement. </p>

<p>In the middle school where I am teaching, my predecessor assembled the VEX kits into  ""squareBots,"" a design suggested by VEX and RobotC. The robot is equipped with two motors driving left and right sides of an eight-inch square chassis, equipped with a set of sensors. The robotics equipment engages kids, but the RobotC language has inherent problems pedagogically; this question is about one such problem in particular because I think the question is more broadly applicable than just RobotC.  </p>

<p><strong>The problem</strong></p>

<p>To implement a wait-until algorithm capable of executing other code while waiting, I've tried teaching the idea to use</p>

<pre><code>while (waiting-condition) {
  //empty loop
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have wondered if more students stumble with later more complex programs when I introduce the empty loop as the students' first experience of <code>while</code> statements. I intend to set up an experiment to verify this anecdotal observation and am fishing for ideas about the two treatments to compare. </p>

//VEX uses LEDs in sensor ports and configures &amp; assigns them as an output
while (true) {

3734,1,3742,,01/10/2017 21:53,,7,1596,"<p>I'm looking for a set of concrete examples that illustrates good use cases of using a <code>for</code> vs a <code>while</code> loop for beginners. I feel that I have a good grasp on teaching them about these loops in the abstract (e.g., definite vs indefinite loops, how we apply those concepts in life), but I would also like to show two (hopefully somewhat contextually related) motivating programming examples - one where a <code>for</code> loop is more appropriate, and one where a <code>while</code> loop is. Obviously either type of loop can be used in either instance, but I would like to prompt students to think more about when to use one versus the other. Coming up with two good examples that are illustrative of this point is eluding me.</p>

<p>To further limit the options available, students only know about console I/O, <code>String</code>/<code>int</code>/<code>double</code> types/variables, conditionals, and <code>while</code> loops. We are using Java.</p>

<p>So, for example, if I wasn't so focused on finding something that beginners could implement, I would show that a good use of a <code>while</code> loop is for a robot that should always be listening for voice input from a user; this is a good use, because we don't know when (i.e., after how many iterations) we will stop listening for voice input. I would then contrast this with a robot parsing through transcriptions of user voice input to identify keywords and respond to them. I've considered trying to translate this into console I/O, but the use of looping to continuously look for console input lends itself somewhat better to <code>do-while</code> loops, which we'll cover next.</p>

3844,1,3847,,19/10/2017 13:59,,5,259,"<p>I frequently teach our CS1 class (taught in Java), and have noticed a problem with critical thinking/planning skills on programs of any substantial size. This seems to be related to two problems: (1) not fully internalizing what tools are available to them (e.g., String methods like <code>charAt</code>, <code>length</code>), and (2) not thinking through/planning ahead/leaving enough time when writing their program. I would like to foster these skills, but I am at a loss. This is a class of complete programming novices. Most students have no prior experience. Some students have a little prior experience in some OOP language, but it is usually self-taught with little regard to breaking down larger problems.</p>

<p>The first problem seems easy enough (encourage students to write a glossary of tools we learn with examples - we only require knowledge of a handful of methods), but students rarely do it. The second problem has been a white whale of mine for the past year and a half. I teach activity diagrams and model problem solving in class, but when I try to require activity diagrams as part of program submission, I mostly get students who solve the program first, then reverse engineer their diagram. I would love to require their diagrams to be submitted ahead of time for feedback, but I do not have the time to grade it before the program is due. I do have some students who show up to office hours and never pull out their computer - they just draw diagrams with me, and they are fantastic students. But, they are the minority.</p>

<p>I fully believe these skills are just as important, and perhaps more important, than eventually writing that correct program, but the program of course is what they need to be able to do. How do I teach/evaluate these skills effectively in class in light of all the other material that needs to be covered?</p>

Particularly with many students only taking intro programming as part of a degree for an unrelated field (e.g., physics, math) in the hopes of being able to do some application-based work, I feel that students would benefit from these skills for such projects.</p>

5128,1,,,13/10/2018 21:09,,4,270,"<p>I'm finding that my CS2 students really struggle with the notions of type conformance and subtype polymorphism in Java. Say we have the following:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class Vehicle {
    // attributes + constructor
    public void ride() { ... }
    public String toString() { ... }
}

public class Bicycle extends Vehicle {
    // attributes + constructor
    // notice this is an override from Vehicle
    public void ride() { ... }
    public String honkHorn() { ... }
}
</code></pre>

<p>They then consider the following problems, with my commentary on common mistake(s) following each problem:</p>

<pre><code>Bicycle b = new Bicycle();
Vehicle v = b;
</code></pre>

<p>Students look at this and think <code>b</code> cannot be stored in <code>v</code>, either due to the type difference, or maybe because <code>Bicycle</code> has a constructor with a different number of parameters than the <code>Vehicle</code> constructor, so of course <code>b</code> can't 'fit' inside <code>v</code>.</p>

<pre><code>Bicycle b = new Bicycle();
Vehicle v = b;
v.ride();
</code></pre>

<p>Students commonly think that the <code>ride</code> method in <code>Vehicle</code> will be called. I understand why this mistake is made, but those who get this correct still struggle then with this next problem:</p>

<pre><code>Bicycle b = new Bicycle();
Vehicle v = b;
v.honkHorn();
</code></pre>

<p>Students now think this is also syntactically valid. Because subtype polymorphism ensures that the method call will use the object's implementation, rather than the variable's, they think that Java will somehow recognize that <code>v</code> is storing an object of type <code>Bicycle</code>, and thus <code>honkHorn</code> is available to be called. It never occurs to them that <code>Vehicle</code> doesn't even have this method, so of course it won't work.</p>

<p>Anyway, they have had two quizzes and now an exam involving these concepts (despite seeing them in class contextualized in other learning material all semester, and theoretically a little at the end of last semester), and a significant number of students are still struggling with this. Any suggestions on how to convey all these concepts? My approach is usually to convey very clear models of how things look in memory, but that doesn't seem sufficient here. Do I just need lots of examples/practice problems? Other suggestions?</p>

<p>I have a task that I started with a group of 4th-6th graders at the beginning of a short course on Artificial Intelligence.  In order to demonstrate how <em>exact</em> computers are about their instructions, I've created a strict syntax for a fictional robot and a series of environmental specifications.  The students must use the syntax provided (in something resembling an API) to generate commands that the Robot will ultimately use to create a Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich.<sup>*</sup></p>

<p>I've also created a little engine that can run this all at the command prompt, and gives back useful errors if the students either generate a syntax error (ie. <code>take rightHand plate</code> instead of <code>take plate rightHand</code>) or attempts an illegal action (such as <code>take plate rightHand</code> when <code>rightHand</code> is already full).  I have not yet given them access to the engine; they spent the last 15 minutes of the previous period trying to generate a full set of working instructions from the specification, and they had a lot of fun doing it!</p>

<p>I have a vague notion about what will come next; I want to integrate allowing them to copy/paste their instructions into the engine to see if they have run into trouble, and creating an actual PB&amp;J sandwich (or whatever components of that sandwich they've actually managed to make.)  I have already checked about allergies to peanuts, so we should be safe there.</p>

<p>What I don't quite see is how to integrate those two activities so that it won't get bogged down.  If <em>I</em> enact the PB&amp;J creation faithfully, I won't be able to do it for every child.  If I ask <em>them</em> to create it, they might just change their commands as soon as they see an error, which would let everyone get a sandwich, but wouldn't be as fun.</p>

The main issue is that they've forgotten the most basic programming concepts, and each year it is getting worse. </p>

I know that there are several types of plagiarism ranging from simply submitting a copy of the colleagues’ code to other highly sophisticated mechanisms.

<p>While there are several systems that are easily capable of detecting this type of plagiarism, they do it mainly when the student submits the final version of the code. Some other tools, are capable of detect plagiarism and notify the student about that (as if they didn’t already know that!).

  <p>As computer science classes grow, instructor workload also increases:
  teachers must simultaneously teach material, provide assignment
  feedback, and monitor student progress. At scale, it is hard to know
  which students need extra help, and some students can resort to
  excessive collaboration, using online resources or relying heavily on
  peer code, to complete their assignment. In this paper, we present
  TMOSS, a tool that analyzes the intermediate steps a student takes to
  complete a programming assignment. We find that students who exhibit
  excessive collaboration typically deviate from the standard work
  pattern, use fewer class tutoring resources than their peers, and
  perform worse on assessments. Our goal is to identify students at-risk
  of plagiarizing, so we can intervene and provide additional class
  resources to help them succeed.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting findings is that approx. <strong>20%</strong> of the students will drop the program at the end of the first year. But the most problematic finding is that after four years, only approx <strong>22%-32%</strong> of the students were able to graduate in a 3-year program.</p>

<p>It is important to stress that in Portugal the admission to higher education is determined only by the grades that the students obtained in High School (50%) and the results of the exams in some particular subjects (Math and Physics) for CS programs, for instance (50%). In the end, only the n students with higher scores will be admitted.</p>

<p>Given the demand for IT personnel and the high unemployment rates of several other areas, several students will end up attempting CS. </p>

Among other things, they liked Discord (and not Zoom) because the ""chat"" didn't disappear after each session and it is much easier to share images and other files. They've also mentioned that Discord was a good choice because they were already there, and so, they didn't need to install another app and create another account.

<p>It wasn't long before we moved on from the specific problem he had (for which the answer was ""hire a freelancer"" or at least ""I can't solve this for you just standing here with a beer and without a computer"") to talking about computer science in general. To his credit, he asked good questions, picked up on the answers immediately, and asked smart follow-ups.

<p>The big one, which isn't surprising in hindsight but which we didn't get to until late in the conversation, was that computer science isn't the same as programming.

961,1,,,22/06/2017 14:44,,8,849,"<p>I've observed an unusual thing happen when teachers try to introduce Test-Driven Development (TDD) or Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) to their classes. Even though the teachers invariably encourage it and present it as a useful strategy, students come out of the class with mixed feelings or actively opposed to using TDD/BDD in the future.</p>

<p>The reason they give for this is time. And in a way, it makes sense. TDD and BDD have high upfront setup costs in selecting framework (e.g. JUnit or Cucumber), adding test hooks/libraries into the code (your <code>import org.junit.Test</code>s), thinking up test cases for all the various scenarios, and then of course actually writing all the tests themselves.</p>

<p>In industry, this isn't so bad, because tests are essentially infinitely reusable, so the cost of that work can be amortized over months or even years. For a class project though, the entire thing from start to finish is only going to be a handful of weeks long at best. So the students see all of the cost and only a small slice of the benefit.</p>

<p>In short, students sort of pick up on a perverse incentive to <strong>not</strong> use TDD/BDD because the benefits don't justify the cost.

<p><strong>If you have experience with such a program, either as a participant, faculty member, or creator, what was the model and what worked and didn't in your program.</strong></p>

<p>I was a faculty member for students in one such program but had little influence on its general structure. Students could designate any course(s) in the curriculum as honors option. If the professor agreed, then the student and prof made a mini contract for extra work in the class. This was sort of small scale from my perspective but worked well in my (limited) experience. There were no special lectures for these students and the other students weren't affected. The honors student had to do more to earn an A in the course, but that was part of the contract. I had to design a more complex project for the (compiler course) students was the only real difference. </p>

<p>When I was an undergrad at a liberal arts college we had a general honors program. I studied math and philosophy, but the program was tailored to the liberal arts. Students were invited at the end of the first year (of four). A faculty committee was responsible for invitations, though I suspect that a student could petition for entry. Every term the program had a different theme, literature, science, psychology, history, etc. depending on faculty interest. </p>

<p>The students read a book on the topic of the term each week and met in seminar for a few hours once a week. The faculty said little as the students discussed the book. At the end of the second year of the program (third year of study) one of the seminars was public, held in an auditorium, with a reception following. These were well attended. </p>

<p>The final year was different. We developed a ""thesis"" paper in our major study area, so mine was in the philosophy of math area. </p>

<p>Since my major was fairly narrow (but also required science study) I cam away with a nearly perfect Liberal Arts education. The only area of the Medieval University course of study that I missed was Astronomy. </p>

<p>However, the honors courses were in addition to the regular student load. The courses were pretty intense, so could lead to burnout. Also, someone already studying, say philosophy, didn't get as much ""broadening"" as I did since they already studied many of the HP topics anyway. </p>

<p>I liked that Honors Program model, then and now, but here I'm more interested in something specialized for Computer Science students. I think that both small scale and large scale programs are interesting and might serve as models for others to consider. </p>

<hr>

<p>Much later, I helped design a doctoral program in computing that had many features of the above honors model. Three years, two of study and one of dissertation. The years were calendar years with no breaks and dissertation topics were expected to be ready to go by the beginning of the third year. </p>

<hr>

<p>My personal context is the United States where undergraduates take many courses in many fields with one chosen as a specialty. My examples are from the US of course. However, other places, in which students are much more specialized as undergraduates have, in my view, similar needs: foster a good learning environment for the best students who want to go beyond and can use faculty guidance. What would an ""honors"" program look like in such a situation? </p>

If a student performs better than their &quot;natural abilities&quot; suggest then all is well, of course. However some students do less well than  they might simply because they think they aren't &quot;smart enough&quot; to do better.</p>
<p>It is a well-known phenomenon, at least in the US, that some students do poorly in math because they have the belief that &quot;I can't do math.&quot; Often enough, however it is just lack of exposure or poor teaching that got them to that belief. It might even be a single bad experience. The same is likely true in other technical subjects. For that matter, it may be true in most subjects, but it may also be that the problem is more likely to be overlooked in, say, History.</p>
<p>The author of this believes that success comes from interest and hard work not natural ability, but that may not satisfy many students. In fact, saying &quot;you just need to work harder&quot; may increase their frustration, rather than their confidence.</p>
<p>Of course a self-perceived lack of ability can easily lead to a lack of interest.</p>

One is to provide a fixed body of student work and then give a percentage grade for assignments, with the overall grade representing the <em>percentage achieved</em> of some ideal. 90% = A, etc. The student is expected to work on each assignment. This is Grading by Percentages.</p>

<p>Another way (<em>Grading by Points</em>, <em>Cumulative Grading</em>) is to provide a body of assignments with a point total assigned to each part, preferably with small granularity but totaling, say 1000 points. The grading is done cumulatively with, say, 900 or more points required for an A grade. The instructor evaluates each assignment and gives points based on quality, etc. perhaps giving 40 points on an assignment that is ""worth"" 50. Here the student can work until they have enough points to achieve a grade that is acceptable to them. After that, they no longer need to do anything and can focus on other courses or commitments. It is, of course, good to warn students who are intending to go on that learning is still required to meet their greater goals and not to be too complacent.</p>

<hr>

<p>For clarity, the real difference is that in Cumulative Grading, the rubric tells the student how many points are needed for each grade and they can choose to get them any way that they like, spread over the assignments, whose totals are also known. In percentage grading, especially with different things worth different ""weights"" it is (a bit) harder for the student to know where they are likely to wind up. They know their ""average"" perhaps, but every assignment affects the average. Therefore with Cumulative Grading, the student always increases their points, where with percentage grading, each assignment can get you closer or farther away from your goal. </p>

If the student hasn't studied Computer Science in the past, what courses are predictors? But <em>this</em> question is focused elsewhere. </p>

<p>Some students, in periods of high demand, choose a field simply because of its popularity at the time. While they may have the aptitude and background for it, their interest may be shallow or even misinformed. It would be good to help such students make better choices about their futures by informing them early of the nature of the field and how their future would likely play out if they stay in the field. The goal is to reduce the number of drop-outs: students who start a program, but leave it before completion. This potentially wastes both the student's time and resources as well as wasting institutional resources. It also risks denying other students an entrance slot that they might have had. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I frequently pose a problem for them to work on for a few minutes before we look at a solution, or several candidates, as a group. All too often some students look at the problem, think it's too difficult, and then just sit there waiting for me to show them the answer. This approach often results in them feeling two kinds of failure: they didn't solve the problem, and they don't even appreciate the solution when they see it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a double problem here, The first is that some students don't attempt to solve a difficult problem - giving up early. This leads to the second problem of not recognizing the beauty of the solution once they see it.</p>
<h3>How can we encourage/enforce/demand/cajole students into making a good faith effort on a difficult problem without making them feel defeated at the end?</h3>
<p>Often the exercises we give students have a learning objective that is more important than the actual solution to the problem. Learning is to be valued over solutions in a teaching environment. But students don't always see that and can be led to think of themselves as failures even when they work hard toward a solution (<a href=""https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/q/2985/1293"">Authenticity Bias</a>). We need to find ways to avoid that outcome while we encourage hard thinking.</p>
<p>The big idea here is that the effort to find a solution, even if it goes down an unprofitable path, will lead to learning. The practice of &quot;stretching your brain muscle&quot; is wort pursuing.</p>
<p>One <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1479171824"" rel=""noreferrer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pedagogical Pattern</a> was originally named Kobayashi Maru after a training exercise that was central to a certain <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobayashi_Maru"" rel=""noreferrer"">Star Trek</a> episode. In this pattern, the idea is to give students an impossible task to give them practice in very hard problems, possibly requiring orthogonal thinking. (The pattern was later re-named to <a href=""http://www.pattron.net/Pattern.aspx?Id=155"" rel=""noreferrer"">Mission Impossible</a>). That isn't exactly the same issue here, where we are looking to encourage deep thinking on deep but solvable problems.</p>

<p>This issue is not just about programming. It can be anything. For example a complex database design issue or a complex retrieval. Or in Compilers, some optimization issue that needs to run fast. Lots of opportunities for hard problems in any class.</p>

<p>The problem of evaluating students then arises, and traditional tests are ill suited for an online model as it is much harder to monitor them or assure validity. </p>

<p>Ideally, any evaluation method should foster learning, not just memorization, so traditional testing has its own downside. Perhaps the current emergency can result in finding better evaluation methods that are also amenable to use online, as well as in traditional classrooms. </p>

<p>My own preference has long been to replace traditional tests in ordinary classrooms, and especially high risk, anxiety inducing, tests with small group and pair projects. This was combined with peer evaluation. In the current situation, it might be acceptable for students to meet in pairs or small groups with less risk than meeting in larger groups. But, it would probably have to be done in a way that meeting face to face is optional. </p>

<p>To teach common data types (such as queues and stacks), we code them.  Due to specification considerations, the underlying structure is an array (fixed length, single type).  There are a couple of places where we need to code a message that might not always work, such as removing an element from an empty queue or putting an element on a full stack.  In python, I'd just return <code>False</code> from the method - it's not perfect but pedagogically it allows me to focus on other things.  In Java, I have to return something of the right signature, so if something goes wrong then I need to throw an exception.  But then in the main program I need to have a <code>try ... catch</code> structure.</p>

<p>To teach some data types, we're coding them in Java. The specification regards a fixed-length, single type array as a primitive data type so to code, say, a queue we build a class with an array to hold the data in the queue and then add methods accordingly.  The array data type in Java matches that of the specification nicely, so this works quite well.</p>
<p>Partly for my own interest (I have experience of other languages, but haven't done much Java before) but also because I like to have an example for the students of &quot;what if you wanted to do a bit more&quot;, then I wanted to extend my queue class to have a generic type.  But this seems quite complicated since the primitive array type doesn't work well with generic types (this is well explored over on StackOverflow, see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/529085/how-to-create-a-generic-array-in-java"">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/529085/how-to-create-a-generic-array-in-java</a> for example) - unlike in other similar languages, such as C#.</p>

<p>The idea is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start the semester with a fully populated product backlog that lists all the components of the curriculum.
<ul>
<li>This means user story statements, detailed descriptions, story point values, and acceptance criteria are all detailed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At the beginning of each week's session,
<ul>
<li>get the product owners (the students) to choose the topics for the coming week's lectures and assessment.</li>
<li>do a retrospective on the previous week's outcomes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Periodically, replan and reschedule the curriculum (backlog).</li>
</ul>
<p>The students are seniors or juniors and one deliverable for the course is that, by the end, they have written a mobile application that makes use of web services, location services, graphical information display, and a mobile database.</p>
<p>Also, the students should be able to use version control, do an appropriate amount of software and UI/UX design, perform reviews of others' code, incorporate automated and manual testing into their projects.</p>
<p>Because they are nearing the end of their studies, I believe showing them how a &quot;real world&quot; agile project might work in the scope of what they currently do (studying) would be a good secondary goal.</p>
<p>My questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the downsides to this approach for the students? For me?</li>
<li>Does anyone have any resources referencing others who have taken this approach?</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h1>Update</h1>
<h2>Sprints</h2>
<p>So it looks like, based on the school calendar, that we'll have enough time for an introductory session, four three-week sprints, a final demo session and two floating sessions available or other work.</p>
<h2>What is the Product?</h2>
<p>So there are two approaches to this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Assume the &quot;product&quot; is student knowledge about mobile application development and have each student select items from the generic backlog to work on each sprint.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Assume the &quot;product&quot; is a mobile app that must <a href=""https://cs4720.cs.virginia.edu/category/project"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">meet certain criteria</a> in terms of functionality and have each student define their app, which will then produce user stories.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Product: Student Knowledge</h3>
<p>This can be seen as <em>subvert[ing] the very purpose and essence of agile development</em>, as Buffy noted.</p>

<p>If, instead, we get another student to be the product owner (or perhaps &quot;QA&quot; with delegation from me as PO), then the idea of pairing can be brought in as the student will have to come to some mutual understanding of the &quot;definition of done&quot;.</p>

<p>It does not need to be too in-depth. Only enough to cover how web pages are made available to the end user, and how HTTP requests work on the surface. Preferably,  something that isn't over 10 minutes long and that the student can understand without prior knowledge of Web Development.</p>

<p>This is for a first lecture at an ""Introduction to the Web"" course, where students with zero experience in coding are introduced to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and usability/accessibility topics. Explaining how the Web works in a concise yet effective manner that sticks has been my biggest challenge so far.</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update</strong>:</p>

<p>For the first lecture, I ended up using a combination of all suggestions. I used Code.org's videos, but they turned to be a bit too lengthy for the attention spans of my students, so in the next opportunity, I will address this a bit differently.</p>

<p>I will not go in depth into how the Internet works and how the data is transferred, but I will use the buses/highways analogy more superficially or even as an add-on explanation instead. I may go into what the DNS is, but that's about it.</p>

<p>In a Front-End Web Development course that only goes as far as using JavaScript with JQuery, potentially touching on a little bit of what is AJAX, the extra details are unnecessary, so rather than focusing on how the Internet works, I can focus on how Web sites work, or more specifically, what happens behind the scenes from the moment you type in ""www.google.com"" in the web browser, until the web page is rendered and ready to consume.</p>

<p>The most important bit for my students, perhaps, is to be aware that every asset on a page involves a new request, something more that must be downloaded. And that every element in your HTML document must be ""translated"" and drawn by the browser. Thus, it is all these assets that must be gathered, and the number of elements to draw onto the browser tab or window, that we need to take into account when developing these pages, because the more of them we have, the longer it takes for the browser to load or update the page.</p>

<pre><code>/**
    This class represents the user-system of the application. 
    There must be only one object of this class. 
 */
public class UserSystem {
   private Map&lt;String,String&gt; users;// maps user to password

   public UserSystem() {
     users = new HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;();

   public void addUser(String username, String password) {

     if (!users.containsKey(username))
        return false;
     return users.get(username).equals(password);
   }
}

<blockquote>
  <p>""The class compiles correctly but has a design problem. What is the design problem? Write a main program that demonstrates it. Use one of the design patterns we used in class to rewrite the class such that the problem is fixed. What design pattern did you use?""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The answer I aimed for was that, since the constructor is public, users of this class might create multiple objects of the class. The solution should be to convert this class into a singleton by making its constructor <code>private</code> (and adding a <code>static</code> member variable <code>INSTANCE</code>). </p>

<p>Indeed, some students got this correctly, but other students answered with all sorts of other design bugs, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>The method ""addUser"" does not check whether the username already exists.</li>
<li>The method ""addUser"" might be used by unauthorized users to enter their name into the system.</li>
<li>The methods are not synchronized.</li>
</ul>

<p>etc...</p>

<p>It is true that these issues can be problematic in some cases, however, this depends on the context and the usage of the class. I wanted them to focus on a specific issue which I deliberately wrote in the Javadoc to this class. However, many students probably did not notice this.</p>

<p>Last year, while I was interviewing students, I noticed a paradoxical phoenomenon: about half the students wrote perfect code (100% in all rubrics), and they all used very similar ideas - similar tricks, algorithms, etc. While the solutions were not entirely identical (so I cannot blame them for plagiarism), I was quite convinced that some of them shared their ideas with others. On the other hand, about half the students wrote mediocre code (60-70% in most rubrics), and their work was very different than others - I was quite convinced that they did all the work by themselves.</p>
<p>It turned out that I gave a lower grade to students who did all work by themselves, than to students who (probably) consulted other students and used their ideas. My grading scheme does not properly encourage students to do original work. Note that the course guidelines do not forbid students to consult each other. But, I still want to encourage students to make the best effort to solve the homework by themselves.</p>
<p>QUESTION: how can I design a grading scheme for programming exercises, which simultaneously encourage both quality and originality?</p>

But in some courses, giving the lectures is often a routine and repetitive task: the material is almost the same each year, the slides are already available. A good graduate student can probably give the lectures relatively well. In contrast, grading the homework is a much deeper task. In programming, there is no single &quot;correct answer&quot;. Each solution is unique - particularly in advanced courses, in which the homework involves creativity and ingenuity (e.g. programming a game or a GUI). Grading homework requires reading each particular piece of work and giving individual feedback - both on code correctness and on software engineering practices. This requires deep understanding of the material, as well as a lot of experience in programming.</p>

It is an annual softward-development project that they do during their 3rd year of studies. Most of them develop a web application in a topic they choose. The development proceeds in several phases. One of the final phases, after the application itself is mostly ready, is to give the application to end users (e.g. family and friends), watch them use the application, ask for their feedback, and prepare a report on issues such as: ease of use, enjoyment, user interface, unexpected errors, etc. This report is 10% of the final grade.</p>

7151,1,,,15/12/2021 17:19,,5,268,"<p>Nowadays, the standard way to learn computer science is at a university, though a formal computer science degree program or at least coursework. What I've been wondering is if there is a certification program or exam that exists outside of academia, or at least outside of traditional degree programs, that certifies that someone has mastered the basics of computer science (i.e. looping and branching, pointers, data types, recursion, stacks, queues, automata, Turing machines, Lambda calculus, etc.). Does such a program or exam exist?</p>
<p>To be clear, I have found many exams and certification programs that cover various <em>programming languages</em> and professional areas of computer work (e.g. repair, administration, management, etc.), but that's not really what I'm looking for. Someone certified in J2EE enterprise development or in Oracle 11g administration may be competent to hold an industry job but does not necessarily have a foundation in the theories of computer science (may not know the difference between a context-free grammar and a context-sensitive one, may not be aware of the proof of the Halting Problem, etc.). What I'm looking for would match at least most of the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can be studied for independently, without needing to enroll in formal university coursework.</li>
<li>Is focused on computer science theory rather than practical or professional skills (e.g. debugging VBScript, writing Oracle queries, or building 3-tier enterprise apps in LAMP).</li>
<li>Leads to some sort of recognized certification or qualification in computer science that, combined with an academic degree in <em>something else</em>, could be considered equivalent to a degree in computer science.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am aware that essentially all of computer science <em>can</em> be studied independently without the assistance of a university, but that path does not normally lead to any sort of formal educational credential of achievement. I'm looking for something along the lines of, &quot;Yes, my degree was in history with a minor in sociology, but I passed the International Competency Examination in Computer Science Theory with a score of A, so I'm at the same level as a typical computer science graduate.&quot;</p>
<p>I am also aware of so-called &quot;coding boot camps&quot; that largely exist outside of academia, but those are still sort of an opposite to my question. They exist to impart and certify <em>professional</em> competency (e.g. iOS mobile app development in Swift) rather than computer science fundamentals.</p>

7154,1,,,15/12/2021 18:55,,34,8903,"<p>I remember 20 years ago (when I was doing my degree in computer science) that there were a lot of instructors who thought that the impending (&quot;real soon now&quot;) transition from using C++ as the programming language of instruction to Java represented a loosening of standards — i.e. that Java was &quot;too easy&quot; and allowed students to get away with not fully mastering concepts that Java handled on its own (e.g. manually freeing memory vs relying on the garbage collector). There were some good points to this argument but it also became clear that higher-level languages like Java and C# allow students to spend more time on advanced concepts (e.g. large and complex data structures) rather than chasing down another stray pointer or memory leak. After I had my degree in hand and started writing real software, I realized that I had spent so much time chasing segmentation faults and off-by-one errors in C++ that I really did have a shaky foundation on more abstract concepts. Seeing OOP implemented <em>right</em> in C# was mind-blowing for me — now it finally <em>made sense</em> why programming to an interface was how polymorphism worked.</p>

<p>Then I need to cover the actual model of sharing code via VCS. That's the hard part. <a href=""http://learngitbranching.js.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">LearnGitBranching</a> is a wonderful resource I'll likely use to show commits and branches, but the main use of that site seems like (to me) experimenting with more complicated rebase-based operations. And a quick here's-what-vcs-is doesn't (shouldn't) need to rewrite history.</p>

<p>Explaining the model is the hard part; showing the application of the model is simple since I'll likely use the GUI. The command line interface isn't of import. But what really needs to be understood to understand a DVCS model?</p>

<ul>
<li><code>commit</code> -- add snapshot to your local history</li>
<li><code>push</code> -- publish your local history to some location</li>
<li><code>pull</code> -- download history from some source</li>
<li><code>branch</code> -- split the line of history into two ""timelines"" for concurrent work</li>
<li><code>merge</code> -- collapse bring two parallel histories into one</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there anything else that really should be covered? These five seem like the key components. Is it worth mentioning that every local <code>master</code> downloaded from the repository is a new copy, and is effectively a branch <code>origin/master -&gt; local/master</code>? Is it worth mentioning that a headless git repository is no different than a local one, and that you can pull directly from a non-origin repo? Merge conflicts happen; should I mention how to go about resolving those?</p>

<p>Context:</p>

<p>The structure of the course itself is rather open-ended: the second half of the course is opportunities for students to share something they've spent some time learning on their own (that's where I fit in). Since I potentially have the greatest cross-section of teaching ability and domain knowledge among the students, I was asked by the professor to do a section on Git before the lab where people get to try it out themselves. During that time as well, students will be working in groups to complete a large assignment, so I definitely want them to use some sort of VCS; it'll save everyone a bit of trouble.</p>

This most often manifests itself when they ask the question ""I can do that? I thought that..."". I've most often seen this when showing students that branching and looping statements can be nested. It has even occurred when dealing with parenthesis and order of operations in mathematical expressions. As a concrete example, in Python many containers allow access via brackets:</p>

<pre><code># dictionaries
foo = dict()
foo[""a""] = 10
foo[""a""]
# deques
bar = deque('asdf')
bar[0]
# and many more...

<p>These students usually repeatedly struggle with this every time a new construct is introduced, as they fail to see how certain concepts from one part of the language extend to the other parts. In this case, it is that brackets are used for accessing elements.</p>

<p>At my day job, I help run a program that invites undergraduate students to get ""real world"" experience working on a technical project with a team, under the mentorship of a professional software engineer. The program is currently 10 weeks long and involves working remotely on a team of 3 on a Java servlets-based web app.</p>

<p>So far, the program has been invite-only, but we're planning to open it up to the public. We're still thinking about ways to do that (might be fodder for a separate question), but in any case we're going to be in a situation where we have more candidates than we can accept.</p>

<p>The program is designed to support students with a relatively high experience level. They need to be comfortable coding in Java (including OOP, basic data structures, and tracing through an existing codebase), they need to pick up basic HTML and JavaScript, and they need to quickly grok client-server communications (e.g. get and post requests). Not to mention git, GitHub, Maven, workspace setup, team communication, etc.</p>

<p>We're not expecting any of our students to already be experts in any of the above. But they do need to be pretty comfortable asking questions, debugging, reading through documentation, and tracing through code. This is a virtual program where we don't get a lot of 1:1 coaching time with the students, so they need to be pretty self-motivated.</p>

<p><strong>My question is:</strong> How can I determine which candidates will be a good fit for this program?</p>

<p>We've experimented with students assessing themselves as part of the application (e.g. <em>on a scale of 1-5, how familiar with OOP are you?</em>), but IMVHO this ends up not being a good indicator of actual experience level. We've thought about sending out some sort of assignment that they submit as part of their application, but to really test for everything we want, the assignment would be just as complicated as the real codebase we give them. Plus, what we're really trying to test for is a willingness to ask questions, time management, and enthusiasm more than pure technical experience.</p>

<p>With all of that in mind, the whole point of the program is to welcome students into computer science and encourage them to pursue a software engineering career, so in a perfect world, the assessment would come across as friendly and not too intimidating.</p>

<p>Sorry, this ended up being longer than I intended. I know this is a very broad question, but I'm looking for a general framework for how to think through this. I'd also be curious to learn more about how other groups are handling this.</p>

<p>I appreciate any insights into how I should be thinking about this problem.</p>

And then in a work context I suddenly had a lightbulb moment by connecting it to what we typically do in technical coding interviews in the industry - trying to figure out what is the minimal level of hints/support a candidate needs to solve a task at the expected level, and thus gain insights as to their capability gaps. And being on the candidate side of interviews in the past, I can report having learned a huge amount by receiving this kind of scaffolding from good interviewers.</p>
<p>So here's my question: have there been any implementations of such interviews as an extensive tool for formal and ongoing formative assessment in either an academic course of studies or an industry setting? And if so, have there been measurements of the effectiveness of such an approach?</p>
<p>In terms of related things I tried searching for so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>I see similarities with the oral examination approach, but I only ever saw it used for summative, rather than formative assessments, and I've also not encountered any use of it in computer science education.</li>
<li>From another angle, it is somewhat similar to what is commonly done in industry apprenticeships and on-the-job-training 'buddy' systems, which involve scaffolding in the context of pair-programming sessions, but I couldn't find any detail on it being done in a formal and consistent approach.</li>
<li>Oh, and of course there are educational providers that actually focus on interview preparation, but from my experience, these generally focus on 'gaming' the interview process, as opposed to using it for the underlying learning objectives, and I couldn't find any literature to the contrary.</li>

One player is the machine and one is the human. The machine player has an additional sheet with possible moves based on the game state, which he/she first randomly chooses from. In the beginning the machine is losing a lot, however over time, when it starts to win, it will keep this move. Over time, when the bad moves of the machine are getting eliminated, the machine gets better, and after a while impossible to beat.</p>

  them like a solution to the many problems I had to face and resolve.
  Some time ago, I was told to recreate from scratch the Shannon–Fano
  encoding as an exercise. I enjoyed that so much! And of course, for
  that encoding, everything is based on trees. It was at that point that
  I was more interested in trees, how they work and their functionality
  to solve real life problems.</p>

<li>Non has implemented Polymorphism before.</li>
<li>Function Pointers was a thing unknown to them (even they had studied OS and I think PThreads are pretty much part of it)</li>

<li>Majority of them are bad at OOP (lets assume they are ok at PF)</li>
<li>There are some students which are/were good at OOP and eager to learn new technology (and should not be punished for others mistakes/negligence)</li>

That is some of them struggle to understand when you should use quotes and when not.</p>

<p>For example, when trying to <code>open</code> a file, they will write <code>open(/the/path/to/the/file)</code> instead of <code>open(""/the/path/to/the/file"")</code> and fail to correct themselves. This is just an example ; the question is not about file/filename confusion.</p>

<p>A related question (maybe I should post this one separately) is about the pros and cons of introducing strings before arrays/lists or the converse.</p>

<h1>Some background</h1>

<p>This takes place in France, in the CPGE (Classes préparatoires aux Grandes Écoles), a two-year curriculum that students may enroll in at the beginning of higher education (post-baccalauréat or post-A level or equivalent) but is physically located in high schools (lycées) and prepare students for national competitive exams (concours).</p>

<p>As a result, the global content of the course is mandated nationwide (including the use of Python3 as an example language) ; I can only choose the order and the manner in which I teach things. The course is mandatory for students but is not the main field of the curriculum (I have 1hr/week of blackboard course and 1hr/week lab session, compared to 10 to 12 hr/week of math and 8 to 10 hr/week of physics).</p>

<p>Computer science is not taught in France before university/higher education. There is only some algorithmics, taught by math teachers as well as they can, using pseudo-language and calculators languages, and not dealing with any data structure (only numbers) and no functions. So I start from zero.</p>

<p>Even in CPGE, the idea of teaching CS as a field in itself is quite new and not universally accepted. As a result, the nationwide CS curriculum for CPGE mandates that problems and examples should be taken from math and physics situations, which leads to string being scarcely used except for file names and data input from files (csv). Yet any concours may ask a problem about strings, since they are mentioned in the nationwide curriculum.</p>

<li>How do I do X? How do I create an instance of a class? How do I define a member variable?</li>
</ul>

<p>These are all questions that would be easy to look up. As such I am hestitant to rightout give the answer. </p>

<ul>
<li>How would I approach this? How do I print the world? <code>cout &lt;&lt; world;</code> prints the pointer, so what should I do instead? How do I account for the edge of the world? </li>
</ul>

<p>If I were to directly answer these questions, I would essentially be making the assignment myself. So this is not something I want to do.</p>

<p>So instead I try to ask pointed questions, questions that should put her somewhere closer to the solution.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can we print things to the console? In which direction does the cursor move? So where do we want to start reading from <code>world</code>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I find it hard however to ask these questions clear enough to not get a puzzled look, but also vague enough to not flat-out give the answer.</p>

<p>Afterwards, I feel like I have essentially dictated the entire assignment. Additionally, I feel that if I were to delete the entire assignment, she would struggle very much to reproduce all of it on her own.</p>

<p>However, in the last few weeks, an additional question is being asked. They ask me, ""Sir, should I go for an ebook or a paper book""</p>

<p>Being in software training, almost everything I have is digital. Yet, when I decided to learn iOS programming 3 months ago, I decided to go for a printed book. However, I also see the appeal of eBooks as in individual, seeing how my kindle filled with dozens of novels. For my students though, I am not sure what I should tell them and why.</p>

<p>Additional considerations.</p>

<ul>
<li>eBooks are usually cheaper compared to their printed counterparts. Sometimes, the printed versions are simply not available or take too long to ship.</li>

share their accounts (kind of like how folks share there Netflix

3363,1,3390,,27/08/2017 07:36,,5,612,"<p>Last week, 4 students from another college approached me with a scenario. They have a year of college left in them. That means, they will be occupied with all sorts of final year things that may and most possibly help with their career. </p>

<p>Now, they want me to help them earn some skills. Something that might help them land some kind of employment. I have seen other posts on the site about the languages taught in the beginning and so on, but these students are not exactly beginners. They have finished 6 semesters and have a half baked idea and some exposure to languages such as C, C++ and Java, and may be even some dot net and Linux. However, nothing is employment worthy. </p>

<p>So, now, I have some decision making to do. What do you ask them (and of course, guide them) to learn? Here are my options (and feel free add yours)</p>

<ol>
<li>Essential Web - HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery. - This is something that is a basic requirement for a lot of jobs where I live. I also believe this is something anybody can learn, even if they are short on time. </li>
<li>Java (with Android) - Learn to build an app. Android is pretty straight forward, and does not really require a thorough knowledge of Java itself. </li>
<li>Dot Net with C# - Tougher to learn, they may just run away with the complexity involved. </li>
</ol>

<p>So, I am partial to Essential Web because of the simplicity involved both in terms of time, and also cost. A very basic laptop (perhaps even a used one) is good enough to get them started. </p>

<p>Still, what should I do? </p>

3393,1,3398,,29/08/2017 03:12,,6,81,"<p>About a month ago (before they took off for their vacation) some of my technology club members asked me if I could conduct some workshops on cloud. Being a lifelong Microsoft man, and something of an Azure expert, I told them that I could conduct series of short workshops (2 to 5 hours) for them and their friends. Now, they are back from their semester break, and I have to begin in 2 weeks.</p>

<p>This will appeal to a number of students as the cloud works with dot net, droid, web and iOS. I am expecting a decent audience (the workshop are has a capacity of 8, and I think it will fill up). These are folks who have never seen any cloud dashboard, AWS or Google or Azure. Further, these are folks who are interested, but have probably never even built a simple app and connected to a database. We are looking at a blank slate folks. Curious but currently without knowledge. So, here is what I am planning.</p>

<ol>
<li>Overview about Cloud, specifically Azure</li>
<li>Why Azure (or in general, why cloud service versus say a database server)</li>
<li>Cloud Services (data services, web site services)</li>
<li>Virtual Machines (and then reconfiguring them to Active Directory, ADFS and FTP)</li>
<li>Using items from the marketplace to complete a project.</li>
<li>Pricing considerations between cloud providers (Azure, AWS, Google) and conventional solutions (like web hosting, blog hosting providers, VM providers, SQL db providers) </li>
</ol>

<p>These are things I am planning. I believe many of you are not just educators but work in the industry (similar to what I do, train and work). So, let me know what else I can add/remove here. Also let me know if you have any thoughts about the topic itself. and, if Azure itself is not the right fit, perhaps something else. </p>

<p>If the topic itself is too broad, please leave a comment (before down voting if possible), and I will break up the question into many questions and link them up. </p>

3422,1,3424,,30/08/2017 14:39,,2,101,"<p>By default, I approach every training I conduct ( I mostly conduct sessions for folks who are in their final year, or finished graduation but looking to upskill for a better career) with a simple underlying goal. If you learn xyz technology, will help you (eventually, if not right away) to make a little more money than what you do now. </p>

<p>I have noticed that there are a lot of students (defined above) are pretty good in what they do (coding stuff). However, they lack certain essential skills that are really warranted in a work atmosphere. Taking my own example, at best, I am a below average developer at best, but somehow somewhere, I end up working in some high level projects. When I self analyse, I notice that my communication skills, presentation skills and simply the ability to discuss without fear with the key stakeholders (like the VPs, CTOs and CEOs) allows me get assignments that otherwise would not. </p>

<p>So, over the years, I have made it a point to provide feedback about non-technical skills to my students. Now, after so many years of training, I want to take this to the next level. instead of just giving feedback, I want to make it part of my curriculum. There lies my challenge. </p>

<p>In a session I conducted last year, I noticed that an entire team of developers were just straight up bad with their English. This may seem strange to other community members, but English, the preferred language of communication itself is a huge challenge for many of us folks here in India. When I finished my gentle tirade by concluding that the reason why all of them being billed lowered rates despite being technically competent (and I was one of the trainers who made that happen) is because you guys cannot speak and communicate in general. </p>

<p>Eventually, despite maintaining excellent ratings for all the previous ratings, for the last day, I got 1 out of 10 ratings for every point in the review sheet. </p>

<p>So, a very long story short, like the English example above, there are so many other qualities that are lacking in developers in general. I want to make it part of my training, but at the same, I don't want to end up with negative reviews either. You folks are in the education domain. Have you faced this issue? How can I handle this? </p>

<p>Right now, the only solution I have is, just give up on that. My pay is linked to my reviews. At the same time, I feel strongly about this. As always, if this is too broad, I hope the mods will flag it, or I can break it up into individual questions. </p>

  <p>Are there any ""pros"" or ""cons"" I have overlooked regarding using Excel
  as a means to introduce a range of fundamental programming concepts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This question relates to teaching a programming module at secondary school final year level (one level below first year of university).  I use Python.</p>

<h2>Learner profile</h2>

<p>Learners often have no programming or web design background.
Some lack essential computer literacy skills- creating and saving files, installing applications and so on (I get a diverse group and have no say in selection)
Learners are all adults, ranging typically from 21 to 61.
Many have been out of education for a number of years.</p>

<h2>Rationale</h2>

<p>Many beginners find using the terminal and IDEs to be quite alien.  Add to that the need to understand key concepts and apply them, it may present a ""barrier to entry"".  Using an application that they may have encountered before and likely have on their own computers (when they have one) may allow learners to grasp key concepts in a more ""familiar"" environment.</p>

<h2>Syllabus</h2>

<p>These vary widely, so rather than include ""fluff"" on the particular one I have to work with, I'll expand on the relevant elements below, which are likely relevant to any introductory programming course.</p>

<h2>Relevant topics to explore in the Introduction</h2>

<p>I'll try to be succinct but can expand on any topics in the comments</p>

<ul>
<li>Variables: cell ref ~ address in memory- not user friendly. Name a cell- can be used in expression, like a variable.</li>
<li>Operators and BEMDAS</li>
<li>Syntax</li>
<li>Boolean AND OR NOT</li>
<li>conditional statements</li>
<li>built-in functions</li>
<li>create a User Defined Function (possibly- not sure on this one).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pros and Cons</h2>

That question was about making a task more challenging for a ""more confident"" learner. I have what I call ""hacker versions"" of programming tasks in code, such as producing a GUI version of RPSLS rather than the CLI style we do initially in class.  There were no extra points.</p>

<p><strong>Here, I was wondering can I/ should I have a ""simplified"" assignment that would be ""easier"" and be weighted ""downwards"".</strong></p>

<p>The class have previously completed a use case (table and diagram) for accessing a course on Coursera, so they had to identify a range of use-cases, including identifying 'extend' and 'include' cases.</p>

<p>I teach a course (introductory) in software architecture at roughly the level of first year in third level.  The outline for the assessment (1 of 8 summative assessments) states ""Derive a test case from a provided use case"".  Examples in class were the ""classic"" ATM test-case, as well as a vending machine and an e-payment site.</p>

<p>At the same time, in another module (code) we used the doctest module (Python) with the testmod() function to check test cases in the docstring.
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/0P4Xb.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/0P4Xb.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I created a simple use-case diagram for submitting an assignment on Moodle.  There are a number of test cases that this prompts.  I am/was considering another (perhaps simpler) use case based around the type of code we did in class and this prompts several types of exceptions and even an alternate flow.  I wrote some code <a href=""https://repl.it/@seanrattigan/multipleends?language=python3"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> as an example of what I am considering.  </p>

<p>The test-case template would have to be completed by the learner to show that they have considered all the possible problems that can arise... for example, a negative int should raise a ValueError, using two strings should raise a TypeError and so on.</p>

<p>I did a sample test-table in class based on a area_circle(rad) function, and so I was thinking this might be an option for the ""less confident"" (as described on CS50 pset2 referenced in the first link) but <strong>as I think about it more, if the learner completes this then they achieve the learning outcome, and I should NOT have it weighted to be of less worth</strong> than one which could be considered more difficult.</p>

<p>Now, after all this, I am inclined towards giving both options to the class, with no differentiation between points, but I still wonder:</p>

<p>1) Should I offer both options?</p>

<p>2) Is there ever a case for creating an assessment with ""less worth"" to allow a learner achieve some marks, or if the ""lesser"" task demonstrates that they meet a learning outcome, is this unfair?</p>

<p>Has anyone done something like this (easier version with less points) </p>

<p>I know I could have been more succinct in my question, but appreciate any feedback you can give. Thank you.</p>

<p>I believe that the goal of a study guide is three-fold:</p>

<ol>
<li>To list all the topic that will be on the exam,</li>
<li>To provide some hints to the students as to how to revise,</li>
<li>To help them deal with their stress.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the case where everything that was covered so far will potentially be on the exam, I feel like students shouldn't need one: they should be able to list all the topics by going through their notes (or through my detailed syllabus), they need to learn how to revise on their own (it is difficult to have a ""general recipe"" that works for everyone), and they need to learn how to deal with their stress on their own (I'm talking about college students).</p>

<p>Of course, during class, I gave them plenty of advises, examples, problems, partial feedback, and highlighted what the key ideas and critical topics are. They had multiple short tests (quizzes) and projects, and I went over them in class. I tried to help them assess how well they know the content of the course during class, and I am open to meeting them. I know that teaching is about repetition, but listing this information <strong>once more</strong> doesn't seem so useful to me.</p>

<p>Am I overlooking one aspect that make study guide really critical to students? What is your personal practice? </p>

<p>I've been mandated by the university of Tokyo to teach Information security courses during my working hours (initiation level). We are 3 teachers, 2 security researchers employed by the university of Tokyo and a tier Infosec engineer with some practical experience (me).</p>
<p>I'm responsible of the workshop sessions. My main goal is to ensure that they can practically apply and test the things they learn with the other 2 researchers.</p>
<p>The first session I gave was about building and configuring their own workplace  and just made sure the students correctly followed the manual I wrote. Yesterday I gave the second session (where the fun things should start). This is when i discovered that <strong>70% of my students have no basic IT knowledge.</strong></p>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<ul>
<li>Most of the students don't understand a single word during the theoretical part of the course (the researchers class, i have no impact on what can be taught there). The 2 security researchers doesn't care.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>They say: It's not our fault if the students don't have the necessary knowledge for understanding us, they should work harder at home. And we are busy with our research.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In the workshop sessions (My class) the students are completely lost. They are trying to do things that they totally don't understand.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What am I planning to do ?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Divide the workshop sessions into 2 parts. Teaching IT Basics and the normal workshop (one hour each).</li>
</ul>
<h2>IT Basics course plan</h2>
<p>This course will be divided into 3 parts: programming, system administration and networking.</p>
<h3>General rules:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>No mouse allowed, only keyboards.</p>
</li>
<li><p>No User friendly OS allowed and of course no GUI. OpenBSD and VIM for everyone.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Programming (15 hours)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Introduction to C (12 hours)</li>
<li>Introduction to Perl or Python (3 hours) &lt;- <em>not sure yet</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>Networking (10 hours)</h3>
<ul>
<li>OSI Model &amp; TCP/IP Model (3 hours)</li>
<li>Common protocols ( 2 hours )</li>
<li>HTTP in depth (2 Hours)</li>
<li>Sockets &amp; Web Socket (1 Hour)</li>
<li>Packet capture and .pcap analysis (2 hours)</li>
</ul>
<h3>System Administration (10 hours)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hardware &amp; computer parts roles. (1 hour)</li>
<li>Difference between UNIX, GNU/Linux, DoS. POSIX Standard (1 hour)</li>
<li>UNIX Based system initiation (1 hour)</li>
<li>Common UNIX Administration commands (2 hours)</li>
<li>System calls (2 Hours)</li>
<li>File descriptors and PIPE (2 hours)</li>
<li>Process &amp; thread (1 hour)</li>
</ul>
<p>I have 80 hours with this class. 4 (sometime 6) hours per week on 6 months. I'm intending to use ~35 hours for teaching basics. There is no way I will let my students cook security related operations without them understanding what they are doing.</p>
<h2>The question</h2>
<p>Is the IT basics course plan is good enough for understanding basic infosec ? (Should I add or remove topics, is 35 hours not enough or too much..)</p>
<p>I'm very new into the infosec teaching field, not very sure I'm doing this right...</p>
<p>I do not seek opinion based answers, but testimony of accomplished teachers who have watched their students grow from IT enthusiast into promising engineers.</p>
<h3>EDIT</h3>
<hr />
<h2>The students</h2>
<p>A class of 26 persons. All graduated a bachelor degree, not in the IT Field for most of them. All Japanese, so I teach in Japanese.</p>
<p>Yes, they are motivated, well at least they are highly active in class. I don't know if the infosec field interests them or interacting with a non-Japanese teacher is somehow fun.</p>
<p>They ask me tons of questions, all IT related. Those questions pointed out a general lack of IT engineering basics knowledge. For being sure I wrote a short test, and as expected the results were not good. (Recently teach them how to convert decimal to binary and hexadecimal without tools.)</p>
<h2>The other teachers</h2>
<p>All researchers and Japanese. My students are somehow afraid to ask questions during other class lecture, looks like I'm their personal stack exchange website.</p>
<p>I spoke with the other teachers, and I somehow understand my students. The youngest teacher is 49, and I feel like teaching is an obligation for them, they don't want to. Writing papers on subjects that don't matter anymore is what they like.</p>
<h2>The diploma</h2>
<p>Yes, they are all preparing a master degree in computer science. The majors differ though (Architecture, software, system administration, security...)</p>
<p>From my opinion, The Japanese educational system is pretty odd.
I mean how come graduating a bachelor degree in economics or marketing can let you attend a master degree in computer science? The IT fundamental I will try to teach them is a knowledge any future engineer should acquire during a bachelor degree, not a master. At least in France. And I feel like this is somehow the same in Europe or USA.</p>
<p>From my point of view, basic IT knowledge is the fundamental you need to understand computer Science Masters degree's class</p>
<h2>My profile</h2>
<p>I'm not an academic person. Well, I'm a security engineer with 10 years of practical experience, not really a researcher. I know the actual needs of corporation in term of security, how attacker thinks and proceed, How to defend against them... This what I should teach, how it works out there in a practical way.</p>
<p>I'm 34 (French), pretty close to my student's age. This is my first time teaching at master degree level.</p>
<p>I don't know if this feeling is right but I somehow feel responsible for my students Future.</p>

<p>We have tried things like offering a bit of extra credit for turning it in on time or going above and beyond on the assignment, but as you can assume the only students that actually get that extra credit are the ones that are already excelling.</p>

<p>These classes are built around building a strong portfolio, but what generally comes out are projects that I wouldn't even want to include in my portfolio.

<p>Edit2: Answering some comments here. This is in the United States and they are working in C# with Unity3D. The class has pre-requisites that do funnel nicely to the content, because they start with just learning the basics of C# then they learn more complicated computer science concepts in C# all while learning simple game design using gamemaker, which can essentially be a drag and drop tool. It isn't until around the second semester of Sophomore year that they start using Unity3D.

<li>Identify and describe important subsystems in the interaciton loop</li>
<li>Implement efficient user interfaces from sensors and actuators</li>
<li>Prototype interactive computer-implemented products</li>
<li>Evaluate and judge user interface designs with respect to usability</li>

<p>I will be teaching computer science students and students from a programme called ""IT"" which focuses on protoyping, programming, and design. Both groups are second year university students. Having recently graduated with a master's degree in computer science myself, I know from experience and from fellow students that courses on these topics are not appreciated (some loathe them to the point of bullying others for liking them). From speaking to the IT students, I know that they see these courses as simple, but essential to their further education. So I am, roughly speaking, standing with two groups of students: One that would rather be anywhere else on Earth, and one that thinks the course is fine.</p>

<p>Now, as part of a course on teaching I have been asked to prepare a mini teaching session. I have decided on the goal for this session to be for the students to reflect on the role of interaction design and usability evaluations in a larger frame - for instance, what relations they have to database administration or to developers. I am hoping to motivate the students to see what their own future role could be, should they choose to go down that path, and otherwise to understand that it does play an important part along with the things that do interest them.</p>

<p>At times I'm frustrated, because I seem to be unable to push them to bridge, what seems to me to be, incredibly small leaps in logic. </p>

<p>At one point there was a question that stated ""using the solution to Q1, solve Q2, but do it for a range of numbers"".  They were able to do Q1 on their own, they were able to independently understand ranges in python, and how to iterate over them, and create lists with ranges. What they couldn't seem to understand, is that basically copying and pasting the code from Q1 into the for loop would do exactly what they asked. </p>

<p>I tried to present analogous scenarios to give hints, heck tie it to real life (""you know how to make an omelette, what do you need to do to make 10?"").  They seemed to ""get"" these other things, but when it came to looking at code and trying to apply the same logic, they just straight up had no idea what to do. </p>

<p>After a long time they were not able to grasp the problem, and I didn't feel comfortable literally just telling them the answer.  They eventually talked to another person who gave them a solution (not what they used) and that helped them finish their own independent solution that was 99% of the way there. After the class after the homework was due, they noted how they essentially ""face palmed"" after the professor explained the expected solution (basically copy paste Q1, as I described).</p>

<p>I think part of the issue is that they have yet to cover functions, which would make it a whole lot easier: abstract away the Q1 part of the question, and thus make it easier for them to make that leap.  On the other hand I fear that I'm too far removed from the point where I had started learning to relate to their learning experiences (I remember when I didn't even understand for loops, so at least I know I had some of the same issues when I was younger).</p>

The language used is C (although this year I started using Logo for the first few weeks as it presents a smaller barrier to entry for a gentler introduction to the practice of programming).</p>

<p>Although the students have issues with many topics of the course, many of them are with more complicated concepts such as recursions and data structures. However, one point that I feel should be easy, yet I'm somehow not getting across to them, is the importance of returning a value in a function.</p>

<p>Concretely, say I want to calculate the norm of a two-dimensional vector, and break it down into the smallest possible functions. So rather than writing something like this:</p>

<pre><code>double norm(double x, double y)
{
  return sqrt(x*x + y*y);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I might write something like this:</p>

<pre><code>double add(double x, double y)
{
  return x + y;
}

double square(double x)
{
  return x*x;
}

double norm(double x, double y)
{
  return sqrt(add(square(x),square(y)));
}
</code></pre>

<p>Although my students have no problem understanding this breakdown of functions, if I left it for them to write the code, they would probably write something along the following lines, which obviously wouldn't work, and they would be unable to figure out why:</p>

<pre><code>double add(double x, double y)
{
  double sum = x + y;
  printf(""the sum of x and y is %lf\n"", sum);
}

double square(double x)
{
  double sq = x*x;
  printf(""the square of x is %lf\n"", sq);
}

double norm(double x, double y)
{
  double result = sqrt(add(square(x),square(y)));
  printf(""the norm of (x,y) is %lf\n"", result);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note: this isn't actual code that any of my students have written. This is just how I imagine they'd write it if I just sticked to their suggestions during the coding session.</p>

<p>What kind of analogies, objections, examples, counterexamples or strategies could I try to get them to understand that, by printing from a function, the value is not ""routed"" to the rest of the program, and thus the remainder of the computation will have no access to it?</p>

<h2>Extra details</h2>

<p>I try to introduce the concept of a CS function by analogy with a mathematical function, say $f(x) = x^2$ (I understand there is the issue of side effects in a CS function, which don't exist in a mathematical function, but I do try to mention this point). I show them how a parameter is passed (in this case $x$) and an operation is performed on it. Passing a parameter is a concept that they grasp easily enough, however most of my students appear somehow unable to understand the seemingly symmetrical issue of returning a value from that function.</p>

<p>Usually, by the point I start talking about functions, I have already introduced the printf() function and shown how it can print the value of variables to the screen. </p>

<p>Then, whenever I propose a problem which uses a function and try to engage the class to help me write code for it, they always get stuck when it comes the point of returning the value from the function. They do understand the importance of getting the value out of the function, but they always suggest I do it using printf() rather than return. Clearly this introduces a problem for the program we are writing because although we can see the intermediate results, there is no (sensible) way to consume the output stream in the rest of the program.</p>

<p>Although they do understand the importance of getting the computed value out of the function, they seem to think it's OK if it's just printed with printf() rather than properly returned from the function. I try to object that once something is printed to the screen, although it does show you, the programmer, the value in question, the computer can't ""read"" a printed value back from the screen gives that it's now just an assorted bunch of pixels on the screen. I even tried to make some kind of analogy with trying to present a picture of a written word to Google (say ""programming"") and having Google search for that word. However, somehow they don't just get this point.</p>

I usually get a good spread of numerical grades, so experience says that I am doing this correctly.</p>

<p>But students who missed an item based on subtleties often speak up when I review the quiz or test immediately after all the results are in.

<p>A concrete example: we ran into attaching multiple event listeners to a single DOM element in a browser context. A student suggested that event listeners are like arrays.

They are me-centric and so are not part of the data, only part of who is centered in the display.</p>

<p>This example points out the many and very vivid differences between a data storage method and an Object-Oriented view of data:</p>

4324,1,4325,,11/02/2018 16:19,,8,1451,"<p>I'm a retired college teacher now teaching things like Boolean logic to students in several middle schools (ages: 11-14).  I taught that module for the first time last week and discovered to my chagrin that I had mixed two different notations.  I'm teaching specifically logic expressions, with very little manipulation using the identities of Boolean algebra.</p>

<p>I started out with the standard notation of logic: ∧, ∨, and ¬ but used center-dot, plus, and overbar by accident in a table of identities.  I worry that using + for inclusive disjunction will confuse students, and I know that implicit multiplication, <em>i.e.</em> AB for A∧B is confusing.</p>

<p>I hesitate to use the notation of programming because it seems Java and Python are equally popular, but with very different notations.  Java's use of ^ for exclusive disjunction further muddles things.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of research or have practical advice on what notation I should use to teach these concepts?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> OK, I've accepted an answer, and decided to use the engineering notation, but to present a table comparing notations near the end of the module.  I chose end rather than beginning because I want the students familiar with one notation before I present the others.

<h3>Problem start</h3>
<p>Input Specification:<br />
The first line of input contains the integer x (−1000 ≤ x ≤ 1000; x != 0). The second line of input contains the integer y (−1000 ≤ y ≤ 1000; y != 0).</p>
<p>Output Specification<br />
Output the quadrant number (1, 2, 3 or 4) for a specific x,y coordinate.</p>
<h3>end</h3>
<p>I have long suspected a difference in the outcome between objects-early and objects-late.  For instance, a student who was given an objects-early approach might create code like this:</p>
<pre><code>public class Point
{
    public Point( int x, int y)
    {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    public int getQuadrant()
    {
        if(x&gt;0 &amp;&amp; y&gt;0) return 1;
        if(x&gt;0 &amp;&amp; y&lt;0) return 4;
        if(x&lt;0 &amp;&amp; y&gt;0) return 2;
        if(x&lt;0 &amp;&amp; y&lt;0) return 3;
        return 0;   // origin or no quadrant
    }

    private int x = 0;
    private int y = 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Whereas a student who was given an objects-late approach might create code more like so:</p>
<pre><code>public int determineQuadrant1( int x, int y )
{
        if(x&gt;0 &amp;&amp; y&gt;0) return 1;
        if(x&gt;0 &amp;&amp; y&lt;0) return 4;
        if(x&lt;0 &amp;&amp; y&gt;0) return 2;
        if(x&lt;0 &amp;&amp; y&lt;0) return 3;
        return 0;   // origin or no quadrant
}
</code></pre>
<p>And similarly later in the same challenge students were asked if there could arrive at a destination (coordinate) using an exact number of moves (energy) and I noticed these types of solutions:</p>
<pre><code>public class Point {
      public int distanceTo( Point p )
      { return | x – p.x | + | y – p.y | ; }    // math notation used }
</code></pre>
<p>While Late Objects students continued to approach the solution as functions with:</p>
<pre><code>int getDistance( int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2 )
{ /* same math */ }
</code></pre>
<p>What I think I am seeing is a preference for Early Object students to employ objects and services in their solutions from the start, while Late Object students kind of ease into it if at all.

In this course there are four programming projects, with the first project completed the automated testing and grading yesterday. However, out of the 200+ students taking the course, only 72 managed to complete this project so that they passed my automated tester for the pseudorandom seed that I used. As my first question to this forum, I would like to get some second and third opinions about this issue before I decide how deep I dig my heels into the ground about it.</p>

<p>This project (<a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/12daxoU4SwQN2Yzmk2aU9d7xbkMcxcvQnliNFTXTWPes/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""noreferrer"">full specification</a>) asked them to create a Java class named IntervalUnion whose objects represent unions of integer intervals, such as [1-5,9-12] or [4-8,11-15], with an arbitrary number of individual intervals allowed inside each such object. This class should then have the public methods union and intersection to create new objects, with the union of these two objects being [1-15] and intersection being [4-5,11-12], along with toString, equals and hashCode as usual.</p>

<p>I simply cannot believe that this project would have been unreasonably difficult for second year computer science majors who have already taken the standard two first year courses of introduction to programming and computer science using Java. And yet for some reason it seemed to be, especially using my automated tester that, based on the given pseudorandom seed, generates random test cases and computes a checksum of the results returned by the implemented methods, this checksum then being expected to be equal to the checksum produced from my private model solution.</p>

<p>For a test run that generated one million objects, easily automated with a Bash shell script, the passing projects took between one and three seconds to finish, whereas some solutions had to be terminated after minutes of waiting and thus rejected. The project spec specified a thirty second time limit that I would have assumed to be more than enough for them even to dilly dally.</p>

<p>Of course I might be completely mistaken in my view about this, so I would like to hear some opinions of other teachers who have taught this same second year intro to algorithms, before I make any announcements to the students.</p>

<p>Since my course uses the three best projects out of four in determining the total course grade, I am currently of the opinion that I am going to just tell the students to wake the hell up, realize that this is serious, and do better in the three remaining projects. <a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MgD841yKzpHJ-hwI9wBg3Y9lWTsX0morpM_63qaeVzw/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""noreferrer"">The second programming project</a> consists of writing method to remove all nodes with given key from the given linked list, and to sort the given linked list, using the sorting algorithm of their choice. (As with all these projects, the grading is 5 points for passing the automated tester, and 5 points for comparative running time rankings among all submissions.) There is just no way that that task could be considered too hard for second year CS majors.</p>

<p>The last two programming projects (""<a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ffj0WotTvY1WQLUH4uWVEOAHOMaL-RIOa-jMmX6wQZc/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""noreferrer"">Packing words in bins</a>"" and ""<a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TikTS0XGeiF-y2v82K7RClWDzZMkdcoZy0637Hk6jGQ/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""noreferrer"">Word filling</a>"") due at the end of the course should be easy to at least pass in that within the simple rules of both word search puzzles, there are really no wrong answers, but the difficulty of both projects is in quickly finding a good solution that scores well.</p>

<p>(As an aside, I am actually pretty proud of that Word filling problem, as its idea came to me last summer during a nice mellow walk, and the solution sketch the next day during a ride home followed by about an hour to implement after dinner, and I wonder if I could be the inventor of such a simple but tricksy puzzle that I simply can't recall ever seeing anywhere before this. Another more interesting variation might be to maximize the scrabble score of the words, since that doesn't actually change the solution algorithm.)</p>

4183,1,,,17/01/2018 12:53,,14,1506,"<p>I have been asked to give an introductory programming course for kids between 14-15 years old. Scratch seems like a good option for young children, maybe up to 12 years old. Python, is also a good language for beginners.</p>

<p>I need help from educators to choose between the two options for the mentioned age group. I'm afraid that Scratch might be too childish for them, while Python might be too complicated.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Basically, the course will meet once a week. However, I have relative liberty in deciding how long the session is and how many weeks the course will be. Actually feedback in this regard is also appreciated. I want the session to be long enough to be productive, but not boring long. My initial thought is meeting for 1.5 hours each week for 6 weeks, and then deciding whether follow up course is a good idea.</p>

<p>I can't say much about the background of the kids. This is part of an extra-curricular school that meets every weekend, and I volunteered to give a programming course to the children to make them more interested in technology.</p>

<p><strong>Update2</strong></p>

<p>The age range was a bit different from expected. The kids were between 10-15 years old.</p>

<p>I started the course with Python and used <code>Turtle</code> library to have a visual output. The kids had some progress, but I felt it was slow and it was a bit hard for some of them to grasp some basic concepts.</p>

<p>After five or six weeks, I decided to switch to Scratch. The progress rate improved significantly. However, a few of the kids who were good with Python complained that Scratch is a language for little children that you can't do 'real' things with. It's definitely hard to please everyone.</p>

I have a masters in CS.</p>

<p>Two of my classes are going very well (CS 1 and CS 2), and I'm very much in my element teaching those classes. They're not perfect, but I have some awesome ideas for building them over the years. The classes are about coding, which I am very confident in.</p>

<p>I am having major trouble with my 3rd class - Computer Hardware and Software. The course description is based on the A+ technician curriculum. Not only is it my largest and rowdiest class, but I'm having severe problems coming up with lessons or curriculum.</p>

<p>I don't have an IT background. I was originally told months ago that I have to teach A+ because that was what is in the course description, and that I have to teach the concepts of the course. The problem is, I don't have an IT background, I have a CS background, and so I'm supposed to teach what is in A+.</p>

<p>I don't have A+ certification, I'm not a technician by trade, I don't know all the ins and outs of different motherboards, processors or input/output ports - I mean, I have an informal understanding of those things, but I am not sure how to make this stuff interesting for 10th graders who all are already students with ADHD and are very bored right now. I find myself not having fun lessons ever, and I even cried in the middle of class because I'm boring and I have no idea what I'm doing.</p>

<p>My administrator says I can't change the class during the school year - I've made it clear since the beginning of the year that this is not my expertise. What should I do? I bought 10 raspberry pis and I want to use those to teach physical computing, but even that is coding, and not A+ at all, and it's something I have to learn myself.</p>

<p>I'm the only computer science teacher here at my school, and so I don't think my colleagues or my administrator understand that 1) A+ is not really a college prep curriculum, nor is it computer science, 2) Parents care more that their students are learning important things that meeting whatever was in the course description. I don't mean to be rude, but I feel like no one is teaching A+ to college-prep students, they're teaching coding.</p>

So, we started with <a href=""https://scratch.mit.edu/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Scratch</a>, a programming language specifically designed for kids.</p>

<p>She likes it a lot, and she enjoys getting visual results fast. Now we came to the point that you need a <em>variable</em>, and I have realized that she has not yet understood what a variable is. Of course, at school, they didn't have the concept of <em>variables</em> in mathematics yet (mind you, she is 9 years old).</p>

<p>I remember that when <em>I</em> learned to program, I was 12 years old, and I had a hard time grasping that, too. Although I'm a professional software developer, and I help other people a lot to learn to program, I find it very difficult to explain it to her in a sense, that she can understand, and that is suitable.</p>

<p>Of course I can say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's like a box, where you put the number 9 into it. If I ask you how old you are, then you don't say ""9"", but you give me the box, and I am going to look it up on my own.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's an analogy, and she understands it, but it's difficult for her to transfer this idea to Scratch code. It doesn't <em>feel</em> correct.</p>

<p>If I say</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's just a name for a value, and everywhere where you normally would use the value itself, you can now use the name. This has the big benefit that you can change the value, but keep the name.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>it feels correct, but it's not easy to grasp any more. To cut a long story short: In contrast to a loop (do this and that for a given number of times) or a decision (if X then Y), variables are way more abstract.</p>

<p>So, how would you explain the concept of a variable to a 9 year old, in a way, that it is easy to grasp <em>AND</em> correct at the same time, i.e. it has a direct relation to writing code?</p>

5358,1,5359,,11/01/2019 20:10,,15,9133,"<p>I teach programming at a university, at 2 freshmen courses. My students are being introduced to programming for the first time, so we have to teach them about algorithms, variables, control flow, functions, arrays (lists), etc. So this course covers the very basics. And every single year I see the same outcome: they get confused, frustrated, and the common question of ""what are these exercises for"" always arises. We don't even cover OOP and don't teach anything GUI (only CLI programs, just for them to grasp problem solving and creating algorithms).</p>

<p>So this year I'm trying to take a different approach: I'd like to start my course by showing them how to build a GUI program, at first by just asking them to copy and paste, until they have a working program by the end of the first class. Of course they won't understand a thing at first. But if I show them all the topics ""in action"" then I can introduce them to the students during the course and review the project we made on our first class.</p>

<p>The thing is, I'm not exactly sure what to show them. I think something like a calculator would be far too simple and might not be too attractive to young, 18-year old students that own mobile devices and see all kinds of cool applications every day. But something like a minesweeper game might be just too big a project for me to show as an example on the first class, considering they will be watching me build a program and trying to mimic what I do without understanding yet, so if this part of my class lasts for too long it might bore them to death :P</p>

<p>I know my course doesn't cover GUI, but I've noticed young students are not familiar at all with command-line, so maybe I can just tell them there are things on the program I'm showcasing that they will learn in future courses. As long as they get to see examples of the more basic stuff.</p>

5910,1,,,14/09/2019 13:57,,1,162,"<p>I'm trying to create a programming competition with personalized challenges for my class, using Hackerrank.</p>

<p>The thing is: I need to show only the minimum relevant code to solve the challenge, and leave out any extra code needed to run the test cases, since this will just be confusing for beginners trying to learn programming.</p>

<p>I created an easy challenge where participants should write a C++ function to determine if a given year is a leap year or not. I created the challenge and some test cases. But when I preview the challenge I get a template like this showing up:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;map&gt;
#include &lt;set&gt;
#include &lt;list&gt;
#include &lt;cmath&gt;
#include &lt;ctime&gt;
#include &lt;deque&gt;

using namespace std;
int main() {
    /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT */
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>First problem is: it's importing too many additional headers and stuff that won't be used here. And also, it would be better to show just the function signature, so I created a stub using the language they provide for it:</p>

<pre><code>function(boolean, leapyear, integer x #ADD YOUR CODE HERE)
integer(x)
invoke(boolean, result, leapyear, x)
print(boolean, result)
</code></pre>

<p>When I save it I can see in the <strong>Body</strong> section the function signature I want:
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/tOOR4.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/tOOR4.png"" alt=""code stub""></a></p>

<p>But now when I preview it, it's showing me all that ""head"" and ""tail"" information, which I don't know how to hide:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;

using namespace std;

string ltrim(const string &amp;);
string rtrim(const string &amp;);

/*
 * Complete the 'leapyear' function below.
 *
 * The function is expected to return a BOOLEAN.
 * The function accepts INTEGER x as parameter.
 */

bool leapyear(int x) {

}

int main()
{
    ofstream fout(getenv(""OUTPUT_PATH""));

    string x_temp;
    getline(cin, x_temp);

    int x = stoi(ltrim(rtrim(x_temp)));

    bool result = leapyear(x);

    fout &lt;&lt; result &lt;&lt; ""\n"";

    fout.close();

    return 0;
}

string ltrim(const string &amp;str) {
    string s(str);

    s.erase(
        s.begin(),
        find_if(s.begin(), s.end(), not1(ptr_fun&lt;int, int&gt;(isspace)))
    );

    return s;
}

string rtrim(const string &amp;str) {
    string s(str);

    s.erase(
        find_if(s.rbegin(), s.rend(), not1(ptr_fun&lt;int, int&gt;(isspace))).base(),
        s.end()
    );

    return s;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, writing code stubs seem to be the way to go, provided I can hide that ""head"" and ""tail"" information.</p>

The course is taught using C++ but the focus is not on C++ but on the core concepts (the language is just there for implementation, so we only cover the very basics of it).</p>

<p>So far we've been using raw pointers to build linked lists. But I was wondering if students would benefit from switching to smart pointers. I know there are many pros to smart pointers, but I also fear students (who are novice to programming) would ""get used"" to leaving the cleanup to the compiler, as they wouldn't need to worry about dangling pointers or memory leak problems.</p>

<p>I think the benefits of raw pointers are that students acquire good practices (same reason they don't learn about high-level structures like vectors or maps yet, until they go on the next course and start with OOP). Also I think raw pointers could be a more ""standard"" way to learn linked lists, since the course doesn't focus on C++ but on the programming fundamentals, and the more C++ specific it gets, the harder it might be to transfer these concepts to a different language.</p>

<p>I am a professional, freelance, embedded software developer. I first learned about C++ in the 90s and taught myself from a book <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0201395193"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">C++ for C programmers</a>.</p>
<p>The beauty of that was that it assumed that I knew C and didn't have to spend chapter after chapter explaining how to declare a variable/what a variable is, function/passing parameters/returning a result, loops, etc, etc, etc.</p>
<p>So, it cut quickly to the chase and I started learning from page 1, rather than skipping forward.</p>
<hr />
<p>Fast (?) forward a few decades, and I no longer code (much) assembler.  Work seems to be split between C, Ada (mostly for defence) and C++.</p>
<p>It has been four years since my last C++ gig, and, industry being conservative does not adopt new version of languages for some time, until they can be seen to be widely accepted as stable (if any of you non-industry guys what to know why, then we generally want to wait until &quot;they get the bugs out of the new compiler&quot;. Given that a lot of embedded can be life-critical, you can understand why).</p>
<p>So, now I am seeing ads requiring C++ 2014 and 2017 (and my latest experience is 2003). The delicious irony of this is that I know, from bitter experience, that coding standards will forbid me from using the new features intruded in those versions.</p>
<p>All of my life, I have taught myself new languages &amp; concepts from books. Earlier this year, I took a leap of faith &amp; taught myself Flutter/Dart (for personal, non-professional use) from <a href=""https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a Udemy course</a>. That was an eye-opener, and I won't be responsible for the death of any more trees in future.</p>
<p>But, I digress (this entire screed has been a digression, if you ask me). I have now purchased <a href=""https://www.udemy.com/share/103LceAEITeFZUTXUB/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">another Udemy course</a> to learn C++.</p>
<p>And, finally, after all of that, my question is still the same as its title - &quot;I know C++ 2003 How to start learning C++ 2017 ?&quot;.</p>
<p>Do I watch the start of each chapter, and skip if I yawn? Do I read the table of contents and take a stab at where to jump in?</p>

It mentions the different &quot;flavors&quot; of CS worldwide, and then it shows some tools that could be used to measure to see how much CS one career has, even though it does not mention where and how to use these tools. The nice thing about this document is that it contains a set of competencies that should be attained from each undergraduate CS-related field, which, by the way, vaguely reminds me of the ABET competencies system. However, I miss the style of the Curriculum Guidelines of 2013; in which there were recommendations on how to distribute the Body of Knowledge into different Knowledge Areas. Also, even it gave a summary of the recommended topics in each Tier (core or elective).</p>
<p>In summary, I would like to know if one should use this document of 2020 in conjunction with the document that appeared in 2013. Maybe is that ACM will develop another document as an upgrade to the 2013 curriculum guidelines? Any comments or suggestions on how to use this new ACM CS 2020 guidelines?</p>

<ol>
<li>Because I enjoy it  </li>
<li>Because I need to earn a living  </li>
</ol>

<p>Reason #2 is probably too distant for most students to relate to, and if they don't already have #1, how can I give it to them? I have been fortunate that my interests have led to being able to support myself (by programming and by teaching it), but from what I can tell, most young people are <em>not really interested in anything at all,</em> which is breathtaking. So, to avoid a future failure of #2, and intense boredom from lack of #1 throughout schooling, how can I encourage interest and motivation?</p>

Apparently the tendency will be for more and more work to be automated, surprisingly not at the grunt level but at the white-collar level. So, we can either get forced out of creative, interesting work by automation, or we can outrun it, creating new opportunities.</p>

5134,1,,,15/10/2018 21:11,,3,238,"<p>I'm thinking about an assignment based around the game 2048. This would be towards the end of a <em>first</em> programming course at the <em>university</em> level and assumes the students have been introduced to at least two dimensional arrays, loops, conditionals and methods. The purpose is to have the students practice these skills.</p>

<p>I would represent the <code>board</code> as a two dimensional array of <code>int</code>.</p>

<p>I would require a method (e.g. <code>merge(int[] row)</code>) which does the work on an individual row of the puzzle when the move is to slide left. The idea is to encapsulate the work of a slide in a single, testable method. <em>This also emphasizes that a two dimensional array is an array of array, and that one can work on a single row at a time.</em></p>

<p>What are your opinions on the following ideas:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Should a single move in the game be implemented as (<code>move(direction)</code>) or as individual methods (<code>up() down() left() right()</code>)?</p></li>
<li><p>One idea for completing the game involves rotating the board by multiples of 90 degrees. Then a move can be implemented as a three step process:</p>

<ol>
<li>Rotate board to one orientation</li>
<li>Slide all rows left (<code>merge(board[row])</code> for each <code>row</code></li>
<li>Rotate board back to original orientation</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Another idea is to show them that move right can be implemented by the process</p>

<ol>
<li>reverse a row</li>
<li>slide it left (<code>merge(board[row]</code>)</li>
<li>reverse the row again</li>
<li>For columns, copy the values from a column into a one dimensional temp array, then perform the <code>merge(temp)</code> and then copy back to the board. This may also require reverses, depending on the up/down selection.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Require a method to produce a list of empty cells for use in picking the location of the next ""insertion"". This could be a list of <code>int</code> to demonstrate how a single index can map to a row/col using <code>div</code> and <code>mod</code> operations. Alternatively, it could be a list of <code>pairs</code> of row/column.</p></li>
<li><p>The last wrinkle is to decide what to actually stored in each board location. The simple answer is just the value. However, an interesting variation might be to store the <code>log2</code> of the value. By doing this, you get an index that can be used to select, for example, the background color of each square of the board. This changes the logic of <code>merge()</code>, so that
combining adjacent cells ups the value by 1, rather than adding two values together.</p></li>

<p>Suppose one starts out with a simple program to compute the roots of a quadratic equation. One can imagine the <code>main()</code> method (very early in the course) looking something like:</p>

<pre><code>
   Scanner src = new Scanner(System.in);
   System.out.print(""Enter coefficient a"");
   double a = src.nextDouble();
   // similar pairs of lines for b and c
   double rad = Math.sqrt(b*b - 4*a*c);
   System.out.println(""1st solution is"" + (-b + rad)/(2*a));
   // print second root
</code></pre>

<p>Now we want to introduce methods to demonstrate decomposition into methods invoked from <code>main()</code>t each of which does some parts of the work. One can imagine method signatures like:</p>

<pre><code>    double getCoefficient(String prompt, Scanner src) {...}
    double computeRad(double a, double b, double c) { }
    void   printRoot(String label, double a, double b, double rad) {
            // called twice, once with rad, once with -rad }
</code></pre>

<p>If we want to call these methods from <code>main()</code> the methods must be declared <code>static</code>. Alternatively one can create an instance of the class and invoke the (non-static) methods via the instance. But, we really haven't discussed objects yet (or at least objects the student writes). Our group is split between the static vs non-static approach. The other split involves passing both objects and primitives to methods as this can get into the discussion of pass-by-reference. However, the latter discussion can be brought up later when revisiting methods in future work.</p>

<p>If we go the <code>static</code> route, then later we must point out that many/most methods are non static. If we go the <code>new X()</code> route, one ends up talking about constructors, even if we use a default constructor.</p>

<p>Where and how do you introduce method in your first programming course? Is the proposed structure too advanced? How might you alter it?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>UPDATE 1:</p>

<p>I mostly agree with Objects early, but I wanted to do methods even before
conditionals. I have students
use Objects before creating their own classes. Thus the many small methods. Yes, it is encapsulated in a class, but I don't need to deal with constructors yet.
My style of programming was dramatically changed when I took MIT's SICP at HP in the
1980's.</p>

<p>To flush out my ideas I created the following:
<a href=""https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~fsieker/QuadEqn.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">QuadEqn</a>. 
The assignment consists of several parts. Part A is designed to be completed
before conditionals are introduced. Parts B, C, and D come later, perhaps as
lab short exercises rather that full blown assignments. I have run this by our
undergrad TA's but would like to solicit additional feedback as well.</p>

<p>Again, thanks</p>

<p>UPDATE 2:</p>

<p>Thanks for all the valuable feedback! I have not decided on using a methods first approach, but am simply trying it out to see how it would come together.</p>

But in our experience of teaching students with various disabilities, including mild forms of Asperger's, we find that even this is all over the map: One student was an amazing programmer but could not finish assignments because the temptation to always add more was so high, another could not see past tiny details that became fixations. Another could not generalize past results to new slightly different situations. Another could easily do the work, but was bored and uninterested.</p>

<p>So it seems that this element <kbd>Au</kbd> is not the gold that it would seem to be, yet no other elements have turned up to predict success.</p>

<p>My observations over 4 decades have been that many people can learn to do tasks involving computers which amount to <kbd>c</kbd>onfiguration or customization within a limited domain, but that conceiving of algorithms or new data types is not going to come to them easily. (And if work or school is far too hard, one will not be successful.) In fact, a lot of my early programming career was devoted to converting tasks from programming to customization, just so that we could free up our programmers to do the complex stuff. What causes or indicates this difference in people - some easily learn programming, others not? Is there another element at stake, like <kbd>In</kbd>telligence?

When they learn about functions, they resist modularizing their code.

In our early, impressionable time together, I stress to these students (high-schoolers) and show them by example (I write lots of code for them) the importance of writing clear, readable code, which is partly achieved by explicitly specifying types for all variables (at first I do not tell them there are other options)</p>

<p>However, at some point, I have to reveal to my students that they can, indeed, declare a variable as an <strong>Object</strong> (i.e. <code>Object x = new Horse(""Silver"");</code>) and that it can hold anything; or, that they can declare a variable as <strong>var</strong> (i.e. <code>var y = ""foo"";</code>) and that the compiler will figure out what type it is. Some of them discover this on their own, of course.</p>

<p>Then I inevitably have students who abandon the good habits they had formed and want to make everything an Object, or declare everything as var (note I realize this is not equivalent in the language, but students tend to abuse the usage in the same way). I am always torn about how insistent to be that they revert, because I know the use of var in C# is controversial in the industry. (See the SO discussion <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41479/use-of-var-keyword-in-c-sharp"">use of var in C#</a> for an example). Plus, the more savvy students are hanging out in SO anyway, and they see some questions and answers that lack explicit typing and other good programming habits.</p>

<p>My question is, since these students are still learning, and since it is my classroom after all, should I emphatically require that they always explicitly specify types unless absolutely necessary?

Adults that were not exposed properly at the right time do not progress past Concrete Operations well, or at all. Thus, it is difficult or impossible for them to become programmers later on, or to go in to other fields requiring abstract reasoning capability.</p>

<p>If we accept that this is true, then we must provide the correct training at age 7 to 12 and beyond, if we want to have people who are capable of performing in these sorts of ways, because later on is too late for them to acquire those capabilities. We can't wait for them to reach the age of majority and then say, ""I want to become a programmer"", because if they didn't have the right sort of background preparation, they cannot.

<p>But, I think there is in those cases a failure to make the best use of the time! <em>I tell them the point values of different items (1 pt for True / False, 4 for Multiple Choice, 5 for Fill-in words) and I say to look over the entire test at the start, to answer all the easy ones (for them) first, then go over it again to get slightly harder ones, then the hardest ones, and finally, review the answers before submitting the attempt.</em> So, I do give them strategy.</p>

<p>But sometimes there is still this tragedy: someone runs out of time half-way through. My tests are almost always open book and notes (but no internet use). When I hear, right from the start, lots of page-flipping, I know it will not end well. Someone is starting at the first question (T/F is at the start, then Multi choice, then Fill-in), and giving equal attention to all of them. I think it is because, even though they know the strategy, they panic and just bear down.</p>

<p>To me, this is work-related learning, and we are giving workplace-relevant training, and so learning not to bear down is a good lesson.</p>

<p>Is there a better way to introduce and reiterate Test Taking Strategy, beyond what I have already done? How to quell their panic, when I hear the page-flipping? Too late?</p>

6042,1,,,10/11/2019 23:27,,1,138,"<p>I'm running into some annoying technical problems in trying to incorporate JavaFX into my CS1 class, mainly arising from the constraints of avoiding/minimizing material they haven't yet learned.  Specifically. the class is an objects-late approach, and by this point, they've seen the standard imperative control flow constructs, static method definitions, and object <em>usage</em>, though not yet class definitions.  They're about to learn arrays, and they'll see class definitions and the basic notions of inheritance and encapsulation behind interfaces after that.  </p>

<p>Up to this point, they've learned to write console-based applications, with input taken from command line arguments or else interactively, using Scanners.</p>

<p>At this very moment, I want to detour in to graphics, because algorithmic art is wonderful, and students love it.  In the past, I've used Swing for this, starting from the templates in David Eck's textbook (<a href=""http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>).  Here, for example, is a simple program that repeatedly prompts the user for (x,y) coordinates and a color choice, then displays a dot at that location and color (as you can see, this one was shown after introducing arrays, but before class definitions):</p>

Children can opt out of the subject aged 16.</p>
<p>Schools are struggling to implement the curriculum, mainly due to a lack of teaching staff that can program, but the hope is that things will improve over time.</p>
<p>The UK National Curriculum defines three <em>key skills</em> (English, Mathematics and Science) that must be studied. Computing is defined as one of the four sciences (along with Physics, Chemistry and Biology), which is why British children must now learn to code.</p>
<p>Some people argue that traditional computer literacy is a specialist skill, and do not think the subject should be mandatory. The counter is that the curriculum is not designed to teach specialist skills, insisting that there is a core subset of programming concepts that every educated person should understand.</p>

<li><p>use 2 or more programming languages, at least one of which is textual, to solve a variety of computational problems; make appropriate use of data structures [for example, lists, tables or arrays]; design and develop modular programs that use procedures or functions</p>
</li>
<li><p>understand simple Boolean logic [for example, AND, OR and NOT] and some of its uses in circuits and programming; understand how numbers can be represented in binary, and be able to carry out simple operations on binary numbers [for example, binary addition, and conversion between binary and decimal]</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically they have a training of 3 months around C/C++/Python/Software Testing/Electronics and the part where I'm training them: embedded linux.</p>
<p>As you might have already guessed they don't have that much time to consolidate their knowings so  when they arrive to my 5 day training on Embedded Linux they don't know much about compilation, Makefile, CPU architecture or even Linux.</p>
<p>The subject I'm giving them is to develop C program that will read an I2C sensor using a real boards and sensors (not raspberry pi, real industrial eval boards). Once the software is developped we are integrating it using Yocto (basically an Embedded Linux distribution generator).</p>
<p>Even given their initial low level, they end up going through the training, it's very hard for them of course but we get there, so it's definitevely in their reach.</p>
<p>The problem I'm facing is that they are not very happy about what they did because of all the suffering that was needed, but I don't really know how to introduce small victory without giving them every thing and keeping them from learning stuff.</p>
<p>Besides the introduction on Linux, Yocto, CPUs, compilation I'm giving the first day, I'm also giving them high level instructions to guide them through their learning and of course my full support during the session.</p>
<p>My high level instructions are more like a plan for example : develop a Hello World, cross compile it, bring it on target (using scp), integrate it using Yocto, plug in the sensor (read the schematic of the board to find the proper GPIO), use i2ctools to detect the sensor on target, read a simple register on the target using C, read the temperature, write a proper userspace application ...</p>
<p>During the session if they are blocked on a problem I'll give them some help and/or proper documentation. Plus of course I walk around the room asking if any one needs help and I ask them questions about what they are currently doing.</p>
<p>So what I'm really wondering is how to make them being satisfy with what they have achieves even if that was hard.</p>
<p>With embedded systems it's true that most of the time you're struggling because you have partial informations, because your system is not standard or even because you're knowledge is not enough for the task at hand, so in the end you are always in the dark until you figured out all your problems and voilà it works you're supposed to be satisfied. How can I help them while they are in the dark and guide them through that final satisfaction that they seems to be completely missing?</p>
<p>How would you guide them so that they are satisfied about their learning without first showing (even partially) the answers? For example I rather have them write the worst buggy piece of code before telling them &quot;may be we should refactor your code with init functions write functions and so on so that we know what piece of it is problematic&quot;, instead of directly giving them a template with a structured code and empty function. I think it's a good thing to learn through errors mostly in that kind of context where it's safe to fail.</p>

<li>How can computer science educators holistically address the
interconnected challenges of designing effective exercises,
motivating students to invest in their learning, and implementing
grading strategies that reflect true skill acquisition, especially in
the context of the rising influence of AI and the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic on students?</li>

<p><em><strong>Subquestions:</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Exercise Design and AI Influence:</strong></p>
<p>It’s been hard to offer students some exercises to help them learn the basis. They won’t really work on them and directly use AI tools, and then once I’d ask them to solve more complex exercises they will struggle and fail.</p>
<ul>
<li>How can educators design exercises that challenge students while
considering the prevalence of AI tools, ensuring that the learning
process remains hands-on and engaging?</li>
<li>Are there strategies for crafting exercises that encourage
foundational understanding without being overly simplistic or easily
solved with AI assistance?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Motivation and Learning Environment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In an era marked by reduced student motivation, compounded by the
effects of COVID-19, what approaches can be adopted to create an
engaging learning environment that fosters intrinsic motivation and
active participation?</li>
<li>How can real-world applications and
collaborative learning be integrated to revive students' enthusiasm
for acquiring new skills?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Grading Strategies and Student Investment:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Given the challenge of grading in an environment where students may
lack motivation and skills, what grading methods can effectively
assess skill acquisition and incentivize continuous learning and
improvement?</li>
<li>Are there grading systems that explicitly link grades to students' effort, growth, and overall investment in the learning process?</li>
</ul>
<p>PS: I'm not anti AI tools, as I'm using them a lot as what they are designed to be : tools. However, students usually use them to replace their learning and replace them actually doing the work, that leads to a very poor understanding of thing. In the long run they will fail to grasp the real challenge of CS jobs in the future.</p>

6122,1,,,02/01/2020 17:59,,8,414,"<p>Recently Python and Java have started to be the de facto standard for teaching CS1/2. This means that students arrive in courses like Embedded Systems, Operating Systems or High Performance Computing without any experience with the <em>C</em> language. Where I teach we have a special ""C marathon week"" that provides an introduction to basic <em>C</em> programming to students who already code in Python and Java. We currently have an exam to try and measure students' mastery of <em>C</em>, but our approach is very empirical. We have <em>impressions</em> about what what they have learned during the first week, but very little of it is actually measurable. Mind you, students are able to do all the coursework, but we do not understand the relationship between their success and our introductory activity nor are able to quantify how much knowledge they gained during the semester (but after the introductory week). </p>

<p>So, are there best practices regarding evaluating their knowledge of <em>C</em> (or any other programming language) separately from their basic programming knowledge? This might generalize to other programming languages/technologies as well, so answers might not need to focus specifically on <em>C</em>. </p>

<p>Ideally, I am looking for something like concept inventories, but that focuses on the mastery of <em>C</em> and not on introductory programming. </p>

4759,1,4761,,12/05/2018 23:23,,12,1689,"<p>We've recently gone through the process of selecting an intern from a local university to join our team for the summer.  We are using F# and almost exclusively using functional programming techniques on our team, and finding a candidate with any exposure to functional programming proved to be impossible.  This isn't that surprising, given that even several senior members of the team with Master's degrees didn't have much exposure to functional programming before joining our team.  However, I've been wondering why so few undergraduate programs teach functional programming concepts.</p>

<p>Having attended a university that taught C/C++/Java for 90% of my undergraduate classes, I found it strange when first learning Haskell that the language was never used in any of my classes, especially considering how much easier and more obvious it makes the implementation of fundamental data structures like trees and lists.  When building enterprise-scale systems, avoiding things like state mutation becomes critical.  So why aren't functional languages taught first, and functional programming techniques taught as a ""use this approach first, when possible"" with imperative techniques and things like explicit memory management and use of mutable state taught as ""only use this when absolutely necessary for performance reasons""?</p>

<p>I would think, with the increasing move towards multi-core processors, and the growing relevance of distributed systems, that teaching functional programming from the beginning would be the best way to prepare students for successful careers in the industry.  Is there a reason that universities avoid teaching Haskell or other functional languages first (or at least including them as a major part of the undergraduate curriculum) and teaching imperative programming as a supplementary skillset?</p>

<p>I have Portuguese as a native language and I teach English here in my country (therefore I'm an English teacher).</p>

<p>In English teaching there are 3 main methods (over simplified below) of teaching used here.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Method: Communicative Approach. Author: Noah Chomsky et al. -> Where you expose the student to a simple exercise and words and how to use them and then explains what happened and follow to more advanced exercises based on what is contained in the lesson (or to what you just explained). {It can be done starting with the mother language and then moving to the language one desires to learn as you progress in the classes, or classes can be taught entirely in
  the second language with a special care with the words used for beginners.}</p>
  
  <p>Method: NLP (Neuro Linguistics Programmming). Author: Various -> You expose the student to a simple set of words translated, for instance verbs, and asks  them to translate from their mother language to the language they are learning. Moving on to vocabulary and so on. On each lesson stacking how to use the verbs, vocabulary, expressions and some grammar (usually in this order).</p>
  
  <p>Method: Immersion. Author: Krassner et al -> The student is taught, much like Communicative Approach but classes are done fully in the language and in a place where the person lives a routine with the language. To learn English (or any other language as a matter of fact) like this, according to the method, one would have to live in an English speaking country.</p>
</blockquote>

Edit:
<strong>I believe this line is causing a bit of a confusion</strong></p>

<p>I did not meant that Learning a human language is the same as learning a programming language. I'm just saying that, in English language teaching we have methods to do that, as listed above. Does CS have one (or many)?</p>

<p>-> Part I believe is causing confusion:</p>

<h1>So above I believed to have expressed what I meant with ""What are the pedagogical methods for teaching programming?"" Making a parallel with Teaching English as a Second Language in order to <strong>__illustrate__</strong>.</h1>

<p>I think from here things were well understood. 
Why do I ask this? And what answers I don't expect seeing.</p>

<p>What I see is that people usually say; ""In this site, there is a very good teacher, or resources for learning how to code. You can use it."" As a way to mirror that, to teach someone or a group how to code instead of pointing to a (or various) method(s)</p>

<p>That is not my question. It is very clear. What are the methods for teaching programming?</p>

<p>====!And not; What are the methods for learning how to code?!========</p>

<p>I hope this can help me, because I haven't really found an answer to this. Or at least not as explicit and detailed as I see in other areas of the teaching world.</p>

<p>I don't need a detailed explanation but if you wish to provide something more elaborated I will be thankful. Nevertheless the method(s) is(are) just fine and what I'm looking for.</p>

4855,1,4856,,31/05/2018 05:11,,5,275,"<p>The GNU manpage (what you'll find on a Linux system) – but pretty much any Unix manpage – of <code>chown</code> (the command for changing the owning user and owning group in Unix) appeal to an “owner” and, as you see, the very name of this command hints at  “<strong>ch</strong>ange <strong>own</strong>er”, too.</p>

<p>When people first learn this, they get the wrong idea, that for the command <code>chmod</code> (which sets the file/directory permissions), the abbreviation <code>o</code> (as in <code>chmod o+w file</code>) stands for “owner / owning user”. </p>

<p>In reality it stands for “<strong>other</strong> users”. So <code>chmod o+w file</code> really adds the writing permission (<code>+w</code>) for <em>other</em> users (who are not the owner or a member of the owning group). It doesn't help that what <em>really</em> refers to the “owner”, namely <code>u</code> (= owning <strong>u</strong>ser), makes it possible for one confusion to give rise to another: <code>u</code> is then confused for “‘normal’ users”: anybody not the owner or in the owning group.</p>

<p>Sure, it helps to make people directly aware of this, but even if they can remind themselves that there's some trap here, the idea <code>o</code> = “owner”, <code>u</code> = “normal users” is so <em>seductive,</em> that they retain some insecurity until enough (sometimes <em>a lot</em> is necessary) rote memorization makes it finally sink in.</p>

<p>What would be a mnemonic or other way to explain it which makes the correct notion <strong>stick</strong> <em>right</em> from the start, so rote memorization isn't necessary?</p>

<p>PS: I'm not formally teaching anyone, it's just what I want to tell coworkers/friends. When I took a university course on Linux I first came across this confusion. There's a lot more about the Unix permission system which is very counter-intuitive, but those are issues arising necessarily from technical aspects. Not an (surprisingly very) annoying and trivial issue caused by bad historical choices for abbreviations.</p>

Obviously it must gather usage data on the device where it is being used, but it probably also includes a database of general usage patterns, downloaded initially and perhaps updated periodically. (Well, that is how I would do it.) In this way, it would be like a spellcheck database that let the user add (and subtract: <em>manger</em> is not too good in a business context) words.</p>

<p>I have long been brushing aside the obvious question of ""how does it do that?"", but this morning as I was texting, I suddenly recalled the article in [Scientific American* (long ago, can't find it on the web) about <strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Markov Chains</a></strong> and a simple program called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_V._Shaney"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mark V. Shaney</a> that would learn and then output words in a sensible order. That is how it could work. It should be quite easy to store and compress such a simple database.</p>

<p>The particular thing I am focusing on is how GBoard offers three word suggestions as I type, so that I can just pick words instead of typing the words in. The prediction is at the word level, not the letter level. What frustrates me is that it usually does not offer the proper tense for a word, making me type far more letters until the proper word shows up. For example: I want to type ""He has started on it"" and I type H and choose 'He' from the suggestions, then ha and pick 'has' then type sta and the suggestions are: start starts starting, none of which agree with <em>has</em>. Why doesn't it go right to <em>started</em>?</p>

<p>Has anyone implemented a similar project for analyzing and predicting or even uttering strings of words? It seems dead easy using Markov Chains. Do you think this would make a good project for using things like a 'dictionary' data structure to store words, and some kind of tree to encode the word association weights?

Having programmed for 30 years and many times created particular systems of multiple connected parts, I think that OOP is probably not the big deal we make of it, but I would like to know how I could have designed the system described below in a more Object Oriented way - to recast it if needed and move forward with more explainable projects in the future. </p>

<p>In brief, the ""File Cabinet"" system I created recently is to facilitate recreating the intranet used by hundreds of people where I work. The intranet consists of many thousands of files and links to internal and external pages, programs and tools. The File Cabinet idea says that there are two basic ways to show links on the intranet and allow authorized users to make changes, instead of asking the web maintainer to make every single change for them. The two ways are: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Present a folder in the OS as a set of links to files and folders. Users make changes by placing new files in the appropriate place in the filesystem. This display method duplicates some Windows Explorer functionality in a web page.  </p></li>
<li><p>Provide a method where authorized users can maintain sets of 'Sections' on a Page containing a list of links in each section. The entire page would render just by reading an SQL table listing the sections, and an SQL table listing the links in each section. Users can add and change links and upload files if necessary.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>I have it working. The appearance can be customized using a CSS file. The two methods of seeing the content look the same to normal users. Users who can maintain the site already know how to move files around, and can be shown how to use the Editable Links method. These two methods should dramatically reduce the effort of recreating the department's intranet. </p>

<p>I used ASPX to define data sources (SQL or the OS filesystem) and ListViews to generate an HTML table or a set of nesting HTML div's to render the content. The code-behind is VB.Net and most of it is just responding to clicks, manipulating the data before presentation and so on. </p>

<p>Could this project have been built in an Object Oriented manner? I think that most of the applications I create, particularly for our department's intranet, are not really amenable to OO, because they basically consist of only a data source and rendering method.

<p>However, I do feel that there is some sort of difference in motivation. Not to do with gender, race, income, etc, but just as a human trait. We have the OCEAN traits in Psychology (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Affability / Amiability, and Neuroticism. These seem to be universal. Is motivation something that varies among people? Can differences in motivation affect how hard they study, persevere, self-teach, find alternatives, and other factors that lead to success in studying and in the workplace? </p>

<p>Does Motivation vary? (Not the actual question, just the premise.) </p>

<p><strong>Is Motivation what we need to focus on regardless of any other factors?</strong> (The actual question.) Three factors of motivation are Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose. I see those all as being self-defined, relevant only to oneself. </p>

<p>I know that since I was a child, anything I chose for myself as my goal, whether learning about electronics, or resisting my schoolwork, I pursued with the greatest force and energy that I could rouse. Everything else was simply not important. So, when I went to college, I already knew I wanted to learn programming, nothing else mattered. I didn't have mentoring, I barely even went to office hours. I just did it on my own, which is what I did in all my pursuits of personal interest, like radio, or learning photography or whatever. So, I am at a loss to understand why college students do not know what they want to major in, or why they are not motivated to work on their core courses. Why don't they leave college and just do what they <em>actually wish to</em> instead? </p>

<p>My guess is that because I was Introverted (one of the OCEAN traits) I preferentially chose tasks for myself that were intrinsically rewarding when pursued alone, and which could not be blocked by having no access to other people. 'Others' and their preferences were the block, so I ""routed around"" it. </p>

4932,1,4933,,10/07/2018 03:38,,11,410,"<p>Background: I’m not entirely a CS educator, but I did run into a debate on whether programming contests are good for students.</p>

<p>A lot of people around me have fun in programming contests. Usually, those contests require participants to “solve” several problems (like 7 to 8) within certain time (2 to 3 hours). Students are ranked by their scores, calculated from the number of problems they are capable of solving, and then the time spent. There are test cases on the submission system to which students have to submit their source files, and the submission “passes” when it compiles to a program which passes all the test cases.</p>

<p>Given all these, while students are (probably?) good at problem solving skills, there are several problems:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Students focus too much on the time spent on writing their programs. Therefore, they employ a lot of poor practices. For example, they always use short variable names, universal headers (#include ), using namespace std; etc in order to speed up their typing. They claim that iostream is implemented on top of C’s stdio and so they use printf even in C++.</p></li>
<li><p>They always put extra assumptions. For example, while they know how to find the “unpaired” integer in an integer array (by taking the XOR sum), they won’t think of how to check whether the array has only one unpaired item. Also, they usually allocate large arrays in advance and skip bounds checking (they believe the array is large enough), which create concerns in both program stability and security.</p></li>
<li><p>They don’t understand how to maintain a large project. Since OOP (usually) requires them to type more, they, for example, manipulate raw arrays with a part of custom heapsort algorithm, instead of creating a struct representing a heap, when they are writing in C. While sometimes OOP is unnecessary, for them code reuse is either impossible or requiring a lot of copy-and-paste.</p></li>

<p>I'm in my 4th year in college as a CS major. However, I am horrible at programming (relative to my peers). I'm just not very smart in general and I'm extremely unconfident when given a programming assignment and during coding interviews.</p>

<p>Because of this, I've tried to go into finance but I'm already behind, starting so late (when all my peers have had investment banking, private equity internships for the past 2 years). Full time recruiting is going on right now, and I applied to both programming and finance positions, but I don't think I'm prepared for either type of interview.

4974,1,4975,,13/08/2018 13:40,,7,180,"<p>In my workplace, my team (working both on a ASP.Net MVC ecommerce and a C++ client) had a recent addition of two young members. One is a fresh graduate and the other worked as PHP programmer for some time. They're both kind of new to the ASP.Net world, along with all advanced concepts of ORM mapping, IIS configuration, performance issues and tricky-to-spot bugs. I'm the owner of the C++ side, and the other team member owns the ASP.Net side (on which I can work a little bit).</p>

<p>We, as senior team members, are expected to carry out our duties efficiently, and at the same time support the young ones in their gradual growth. They're doing their best, and our company allowed me a bit of dedicated time to spend for their education.</p>

I think these skills come naturally by spending time on the particular project / language / framework and only if one accepts (or is forced) to take responsibilities.</p>

<p>I've worked through the tutorials at <a href=""https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql"" rel=""noreferrer"">Code Academy</a> and <a href=""https://sqlbolt.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">SQLBolt</a>. They gave me a great foundation into the basics but when I look at actual SQL searches in the database I'm using, they're much more complex than the ones in these tutorials and use query terminology that's never introduced, to the point that I'm somewhat overwhelmed and confused by just looking at them.</p>

<p>Part of this is related to how simplistic the examples are in the tutorials and part is because the database I'm looking at is huge. Dozens of tables, some with 20+ columns each and lots of ways to compare the information.</p>

<p>The difficulty I'm having is that proficiency seems to require knowing what searches are ""easy"" with no actual experience... and then finding out what is even possible to simplify the search I'm trying to write.</p>

<p>Considering the complexity of the database I'm using and my current skill level, how can I ease into more complex searches while still finding the results I need from the information?</p>

<p>Some notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>I do have people who are willing to help me as needed but I'm concerned about bothering them too much with stuff that should have been simple for me to solve on my own, particularly as they are quite busy. How can I determine what's simple and what's complex?</li>
<li>Another part of this is that talking with someone isn't a great way for me to learn, as I quickly forget what they've said, so I don't retain the information. I want to learn what they're telling me, not just have it redone ""correctly"" for me. The tutorials have been good because they give me the chance to actually write the searches myself.</li>

Then get ideas from the kids about instructions to solve the problem without knowing what the word is.

<li><p>Substitution coding. Starts out as how to pass a secret message like a spy. My aim is to end up with something like a compiler or maybe zipf encoding - substitution rules that make the encoded message denser than the final form. Here, I'm a bit stuck for a solid example. Maybe a cipher system with a limited vocab?  The principal concept is [substitution / naming / functions].</p></li>
<li><p>Logo.  Basically a demo lesson using function definition in Logo to draw something recognizable (Captain America's shield, say), comparing how easy it is if I create my own substitution rules (functions).  Also demo recursion, substitution inside the substitution rule with the Koch snowflake, maybe some other fractals. This is a demo of Logo, concept is mainly [functions].</p></li>
<li><p>Handwriting recognition deep learning.  Set up a recognizer (this is easy enough, right?) and give the kids a chance to test their own handwriting (this will be hardest on my son, I reckon).  Discuss how it works as lots of layers of functions which had to learn to work together. [machine learning]</p></li>

<p>I have identified a serious lack of small to medium-sized exercises on Haskell's ""higher abstractions,"" such as applicatives, monads, monoids, foldables, transversables and monad transformers. When studying, say, the use of higher-order functions such as <code>foldr</code>, many materials contain a good set of exercises, starting from simple ones and proceeding to varying levels of challenge. When it comes to the ""higher abstractions,"" the situation is, in my humble opinion, extremely poor, even after combing through many sources and trying to extract everything that is available.</p>

<p>To help the student understand and appreciate these abstractions I would expect to see highly varying, small to medium-sized exercises. These exercises should make the student, among other things,</p>

<ul>
<li>use these abstractions</li>
<li>write instances of these abstractions</li>
<li>identify cases where these abstractions could be defined and used</li>
<li>identify cases where these abstractions can <em>not</em> be defined and used</li>
<li>compare the use of these abstractions to not using them.</li>
</ul>

<p>As background information, my two favourite materials are <em>Hutton's Programming in Haskell (2nd ed.)</em> for a solid basis and Allen's and Moronuki's <em>Haskell Programming from First Principles</em> for some of their material on more advanced topics.</p>

<p>While Hutton's <em>Programming in Haskell</em> is a superb text for the basics, a good example of what is missing is its chapter ""Foldables and friends"" on monoids, foldables and transversables. The exercise set does not contain a single exercise that would make the student practice the use of these abstractions. It does not contain a single exercise of identifying the existence of these abstractions in some domain.</p>

<p>These abstractions are, in my opinion, an order of magnitude more difficult to assimilate than, say, higher-order functions. There is also at least an order of magnitude difference in the number of exercises available, but it is in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>Granted, <em>Haskell Programming from First Principles</em> does make you write a lot of instances of these abstractions in classic cases. Unfortunately it missed the other parts, and made me feel a bit like having proved a bunch of lemmas with very little idea of where those lemmas might be useful.</p>

<p>I think this is relevant for the Haskell community in general. If we can find pointers to good exercises, or examples that can be turned into exercises, I can create a public github repo and start collecting the material into one place.</p>

<p>Long version:
I am not a teacher but a software engineer. Yesterday evening, while discussing what the day was like with my five years old son I told him that I worked on an annoying bug, that ended up being caused by a race condition. He then asked me what a race condition is.</p>

<p>I tried to explain the concept to him by making the analogy with multiple people all writing a story on the same blackboard. If they all write their story at the same time then one person might start writing over part of a story already written by someone else.</p>

<p>However I think that this analogy was probably not the best because he then asked me which person did “won”. I explained to him that nobody did win because the end result was that the “story” that was written on the blackboard was not making any sense. </p>

<p>He then asked me how did I solved the problem and I told him that I did give each story writer his own blackboard.</p>

<p>So I am looking for a good way to explain what is a race condition to a five years old, ideally without using a programming terminology because that would mean nothing to him.</p>

She needed some help to have a better understanding of programming, and increase her grade in this field. Computer science is not the main subject of her degree which is based on maths and physics.</p>

<p>I asked her if she wanted to emphasise on a difficult subject for her, or if I should start from scratch and explain programming as if it was totally new for her. She chose the second solution, so I started to explain her the base of programming, binary, variables, functions, conditional statements, loops. And now I emphasis on the most common data structure ever, the array.</p>

<p>I teach her how to use an array, manipulate its element, etc...
As she had to use programming to solve problems of graph theory, physics measurements, and mathematical algorithms which use a lot of matrices and arrays, I spend about six hours to make her be more familiar with it. </p>

<p>I simplified it to make her use one-dimensional arrays with a simple algorithm, and she just told me that she can’t understand how arrays will be of any use for her, for her everyday life. She aims to get job in the field of statistics.</p>

<p>I explained to her, that she uses array everyday without thinking about it. For example when you log in a website, there’s somewhere an array (or an object) which stores your username, password, email, and compares it to what is stored in a database. But she didn’t feel very enthusiastic.</p>

<p>So  I can understand that not everybody enjoys programming, and as I am not a statistician I can’t really tell her about how useful this can be for a statistician.</p>

5157,1,5162,,26/10/2018 18:59,,9,410,"<p>I have a group of students with a very shaky understanding of functions and their purpose (encapsulation, reuse, modularization). The assignments I give them require them to write simple functions that return boolean T/F, an integer or a simple Python object (str, list, etc.), then have the caller use the returned value in a print statement. Their programs are written in Python and run from the Windows command line.
The problem is that from the command line, the programs work but if you look inside it's a mess. The functions ignore the parameters to reach into the main for global variables (misunderstand the idea of parameter passing), the input validity checking is done in the caller (defeating the idea of encapsulation, e.g is day of month valid for a given month), or the function prints the result without returning anything. The worst that I get is the function does all the work of the main and of the function, for example when asking for a simple function to add 1 to its argument, I get:</p>

<pre><code>def add1(x):
    myval = int(input(""Number?""))
    print(myval+1)

add1(x)
</code></pre>

<p>...which of course is nonsense.</p>

<p>Here's my question... Can I craft an exercise that calls a simple function like add1() that would give a dramatically wrong output, e.g. cause the screen to ""blow"" up if the function printed instead of returned, or stalled if it kept asking for input. I'm thinking of something that reads a large file of text or numbers.</p>

<p>The students are at the community college level and are not programmers -- they are in electronics technology (and some are convinced that there is no software involved in electronics).

<p>After careful consideration of different projects we could pursue, we came up with the idea of a platform that could provide comp.

We would take on any willing instructors with backgrounds in coding that would be able to use the students as a means of developing their personal projects, while simultaneously teaching them how to code. Everyone benefits. We hope to expand this past just students, and take on more and more staff. The students would leave the program with experience in their field and proficiency of 1 or more languages.</p>

<p>The main goal of our platform is to provide a network for students and teachers to collaborate and work on projects while developing their skills as coders.</p>

<p>Where we are at
Right now we are in the planning phase. We need to reach out to different communities for not only advice but for reassurance that people would want to take part in this project with us. </p>

<p>What we need help with
If anyone has had experience with assembling people for a project, or just starting a project in general, we would really appreciate any advice you might have for us.</p>

<p>So our question is
How do we go about finding people that would be willing to invest in our idea? We would need teachers, students, and anyone else who is qualified and willing to work with us.</p>

<p>Due to the high number of students per semester and limited resources, grading is heavily assisted by automatic unit tests. The TAs will still scan through the code, but if all or most of the test cases fail and there is no simple fix in sight, students will get 0 points on an assignment.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this can happen very quickly. Consider implementing a balanced tree as an example. If students fail to correctly reference the nodes, insertion, removal and searching, - despite being implemented correctly if seen individually - will not work and can hardly be tested.</p>

<p>As expected, some students do complain about their poor grade and argue that <em>""although they acknowledge that their data structure does not work entirely, they at least implemented various sub-tasks correctly""</em>. This may even be correct, but the TAs very often do not have the time to dig deep in the code and grade the internal functions of the students implementation.

Can you recommend anything that has a week-by-week plan with homeworks and in-class assignments to see if we're able to fit in limits we have?</p>

<p>We are now preparing to launch a new training program, which will be designed for government managers and policy makers whose competencies will include managing big data. The problem is that the courses for them should be without mathematics and programming, because the target group of applicants are humanities.</p>
<p>After some thought, we came to the conclusion that it makes sense for us to develop four subjects: data science, decision support systems, data mining, and big data management infrastructure.  We already had work on all of these subjects, but there's a lot of math involved.</p>
<p>Basically, one could focus on what a manager can use (including some useful applied tools), how it all works in general terms, and the methods of rational thinking, critical thinking and decision-making (including those based on big data, the modern philosophy of causality - by Judah Perle, for example).</p>
<p>What experience do you have in teaching these kinds of programs, what advice do you have for this kind of audience? Perhaps there are some recognized courses already that we don't know about so we don't have to reinvent the wheel?</p>

5403,1,5404,,14/02/2019 15:43,,10,967,"<p>In my beginner experience as a teacher, the thing that's strucking me most is a sensation of my students' inability to express their (valid!) thoughts in code. Let me deepen it a bit.</p>

<p>I inherited a last year class that was supposed to know C from their previous years. Anyway they struggled in manually tracing the execution of the code they see, being it mine or theirs.
After some work I could test and evaluate them again and it now seems to me that they are actually quite good at reasoning about a sort of ""abstract idea"" of what they want their algorithms to do: they can use our natural language to say things like scan this, sum that, stop here or there, and they are pretty much correct. What they seem to have big difficulties in is saying the same thing using a formal language.</p>

<p>They moreover have this (to me, crazy) habit of writing huge blocks in main() without splitting anything, and even worse the only way they think about of producing output is writing to the world: they don't contemplate returning from a function. One (brilliant!) boy once asked me with big amazement after my seemingly strong assertion: ""oh, so you mean that strlen() is a function?"".
Of course I may understand where this comes from, but I suspect it's not healthy for their learning.</p>

<p>It seems to me that a possible reason of this observed behaviour might lie in having taught them to build huge state machines without making them have a clue that they are building huge state machines: they can reproduce some they have already seen but are really lost when needing to make a new one. Even having them apply small modifications seems to me more like a blind trial from their part than some reasoning about the meanings. The building blocks of the language do not play well together in their minds or they are just unable to think about the state transitions in the code.</p>

<p>If I have to push myself a bit more I can say that I suspect all this is a reflection of the non composability of state machines, making their use in teaching to absolute novices not effective, whereas functions are known to be composable and would presumably lead to better results, <strong>in terms of being a means for mapping an individual's thoughts to formal language</strong>.</p>

<p>Is my analysis plausible? Have you experienced anything similar? Is there any available scientific literature on these phenomena? How would you test them to investigate deeper their difficulties and how would you try to show them a more effective route? Is there anything you would do to improve the methodology for next classes?</p>

<p>Should state machines be introduced somehow more explicitly, with better examples, showing how do they actually solve problems before throwing them to the poor students with a burden of syntax that they know nothing about? They even told me clearly that syntax is the only thing they focused all their energies on in their previous years.</p>

<p>What I am doing in younger classes is proposing functions first (as in functional paradigm), to solidify the concept of building a small composable block that has input and output, waiting a bit more in the future to introduce state transitions using the classic drawing turtle of fame with the hope that its visual feedback might make things tangible.</p>

5445,1,,,27/02/2019 21:17,,3,1367,"<p>I am growing suspects that the ubiquitous analogy between algorithms and recipes be not so well founded, especially for theoretically oriented students. I am wondering if this may contribute to the evidence of students having difficulties with even simple loops. I believe that bad analogies make more harm than no analogies, so I ask.</p>

<p>My wondering is that recipes, if superficially similar to the idea of sequential steps, do not really <em>encode the logic</em> that is sought to be explained: the logic of state transitions.
Of course there are state transitions in recipes, but i do not feel they being the <em>characterising properties</em>, nor are they the <em>target of attention</em> (I also like cooking). State transitions in recipes (and similar physical operations analogies) seem to be not even caused by the ""program"" but just happening because of physics. And typically what we get from students struggles is exactly their inability to follow (or design) state transitions. Probably because a fundamental property of a real computer program is that of being the acting cause and not the observer of state transitions, and this is not captured by the analogy. Another issue is that computing systems are typically discrete while physical analogies tend to be continuous, both in time and measured (variables) dimensions.</p>

<p>What screams for attention in recipes are instead ""data"" dependency constraints (cannot throw in the spaghetti before the water boils), or a kind of ""event-driven"" situation, and i do not recall seeing students struggling with data dependencies, which might be because 1. the recipe analogy is good in teaching them or (I suspect more probably) 2. it's not what they need help for: data dependencies being more innate than state transitions, especially in a forcefully sequential environment (of course this is a hypothesis, any experiments known?).</p>

<p>On a more concrete side it seems to me that the real world software counterpart of recipes are those things that we usually call scripts: something I love and had made a lot of and which I know perfectly fit their niche problems, but not something that is known for exposing nice theoretical properties, which, I suspect, is what matters more when learning, in order to build a clear mental model of algorithms (and because my pupils are generic science students and not specialist computer developers).</p>

<p>Realistic programs, and especially subprograms if we want to divide et impera, are not sequences of operations but sequences of state transitions.</p>

<p>What do you think of this analysis? Have any empirical data? Does an analogy that takes more care of state transitions exist and I have missed it?</p>

5451,1,5468,,07/03/2019 14:59,,5,670,"<p>I'm becoming more and more convinced that starting with an imperative attitude is not doing a favor to the students, especially if it's all about scheduling and repeating some <code>scanf</code> and <code>printf</code> in loops. I ignore if this teaching technique has any systematic treatment or evidence of efficacy. To me it seems that it produces students unable to process data, as I'll explain soon.</p>
<p>I have a class of students who show the following features, for which I'm unable to find a good framework besides listing them (but perfectly and angrily knowing where they come from):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>They are convinced that <code>for (i=0; i&lt;5; i++) return i</code> is going to return 5 results. They are obviously so much confused in thinking that they're doing a minor variation of <code>for (i=0; i&lt;5; i++) printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, i)</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Given a function that needs X as input they constantly point out to me that somewhere in the first lines we need to read X from somewhere, they just ignore that we can add another argument as needed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>They cannot trace the execution of a for loop, they don't check the loop condition: to them it's just &quot;I do the body N times&quot;, I don't yet know what do they think of the index used in the loop besides that it magically happens to take the values 0..N-1.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm on the edge of despair. Just showing them how I'd do something and explaining its operational interpretation obviously doesn't work, they even show a sort of resistance to abandon this method of doing any imaginable thing just by throwing <code>scanf</code>'s and <code>printf</code>'s around. Do you have any suggestions for better framing their difficulties, or any examples that might be illuminating in this situation?</p>
<p>I am finding incredibly difficult to produce some wrong code that might appear correct in their eyes and could possibly shock them and making them understand that things are a bit different from what they believe. Any ideas?</p>

5456,1,,,12/03/2019 10:48,,2,198,"<p>I'm going to teach using the well known drawing turtle, with one developed by me to fit my students, so in case it can also be modified. It features drawing movement, non-drawing movement and pen color change.</p>

<p>The main goal is letting them have a strong visual feedback and appreciate the decomposition of complex movements. I have some examples that use functions to represent ""subtasks"" and repetitions to generate nice drawings.</p>

<p>I'm anyway a bit stuck here, say at the visual artist stage, I'd like to show them the use of a while kind of loop instead of a statically limited for, but I don't have good ideas besides using the ""while"" condition to stop some recursion based for example on the next step length (imagine drawing a spiral with increasing step length and wanting to halt at some point).</p>

<p>It seems to me that my main difficulty has to do with the absence of interesting states from the examples, the only one that comes to mind being precisely the use of a step length.</p>

<p>The system also features 2 things.</p>

<ul>
<li>A stack for saving turtle configurations, you can push the current position and pop it later... Fractals? It seems that those coming to my mind are more easily accessed by recursion than by a stack.</li>
<li>The ability to save a user state and access it, it can be used for example to keep a counter that changes when desired and is then used to choose a pen color from a palette. It can contain arbitrary data and the motivation was to use it as an aid for learning about mutating variables.</li>

6168,1,,,24/01/2020 00:31,,1,133,"<p>I may tutor a student who just started learning ""school C"", by which I mean that strange kind of C seen only on school books (and that in my opinion ""cripples the mind"", so to say, but I digress). I need to quickly understand her misconceptions, as she is saying that she has many doubts, she says ""the char function"", ""the for function"", ""no idea what ++ is"" and the like.</p>

<p>She looks brilliant nonetheless, besides having great confusion on cs things (and a decreasing engagement of course), therefore I'd prefer a very direct and practical way of getting to her errors, not spending a lot of time repeating concepts that might bore her. I'm quite good at understanding my pupils' mind maps given their answers and fix them but not so good at creating questions/problems that pose the right challenges and let the misconceptions provoke errors in their solutions, mostly because it all seems too simple to me whereas it looks like many students find this topic complex. The only thing that comes to my mind is generating a lot of situations hoping to see her wrong somewhere, clearly not a systematic approach.</p>

<p>Let's say, in our terms, that I don't know well how to identify the corner cases that I ought to be testing and I feel like risking to follow only the happy paths of her thought processes.</p>

<p>For example, I read somewhere that a common misconception is to think that given something like <code>while (relation) { ... }</code> then the student thinks that whenever the relation becomes false something happens (break? I don't know), anywhere in the midst of the block. (I have a compelling feeling of why this specific case might happen).</p>

<p>What are, from your experience (hoping not to make the question too subjective), or from literature, the most common misconceptions and false beliefs that beginning students have? What problems can I give her to extract the most errors?</p>

<p>I think both reading and writing problems, from tracing the execution to fizzbuzz or rainfall style, are there other important exercise types that I shouldn't forget? Anything without code?</p>

7568,1,7571,,12/11/2022 12:45,,4,86,"<p>The more experience I have in teaching CS the more I become convinced that one of the most difficult ideas to grasp for (beginner) students is that of <em>changing the inputs</em> (if not the most difficult of all).
This is so trivial and basic for us that I think we struggle to understand what's so difficult in it, at least I do.
This point is what I call the algebraic aspect of computation, because, at a beginner level, it has something to do with the meaning of the dreaded <code>x</code> in mathematics that so many students seem to fail to understand, which is to say, the idea of <em>variables</em>.</p>
<p>In today's frustration I bring you the case of my students who, having nonetheless spent weeks copying and writing formulas in a spreadsheet, still persist in writing formulas without variables, even in cases where it's &quot;just so obvious&quot; that we want a result of a computation <em>with some data</em>: they just read the data and write a constant in the formula. <strong>I can't understand the reasoning behind this: what, in their opinion, is the usefulness of writing such a formula?</strong></p>
<p>It became quite apparent observing them when doing it correctly that their only drive to use variables (cell references) is <em>&quot;the teacher wants it so&quot;</em>: of course this means that they have no will whatsoever of doing it when I'm not watching.</p>
<p>There's even another, so to say interesting, fact: when they need a small computation for themselves, they prefer going to their backpack, take out a calculator and doing it with maybe many calculation steps and often incur some errors and <em>doing it again maybe from the beginning because they lost the intermediate results</em> instead of using 2 or 3 cells of the spreadsheet that they have ready in front of them.
Fully oblivious of the usefulness of the tool that we have studied for months.</p>
<p>I know that this student behaviour is not new and I'm sure a lot of teachers have dealt with it.</p>
<p>The main way I (desperately) try to make them aware of all this is by saying <em>and demonstrating with lots of examples</em> that:</p>
<ul>
<li>We want it to work when we change data.</li>
<li>We want to be able to use the same formula for many other cases (copy and make a long table).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>But this seems highly ineffective</em>: no connection with their inner drive, even when we beforehand state the computation that we're going to realize and see that it <em>naturally wants to be repeated in different cases</em>.</p>
<p>It struck me recently that, in asking them a question of the kind &quot;what's the result of such and such step of our computation&quot; (we did a thing made of 3 steps: <span class=""math-container"">$f(g(h(x)))$</span>) they wrote &quot;7&quot;.</p>
<p>Again, fully oblivious of the fact that &quot;the step&quot; can and will be done with differing inputs (of course we had done it and saw it on the screen and remarked it many times).</p>
<p>I'd like to ask if you can share your experience or intuitions about this issue, and if you have any suggestions.
Especially since it's so foundational that nothing can be done in computing without this awareness, besides of course they merely copying what I do or guessing what I want from them without having any clue about the meaning.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the goal for the students in these classes is to learn to use a spreadsheet and, in the minds of those who have no idea who the students are, make some data analysis.
Keep in mind, moreover, that these students are not going to be scientists of any kind, the opposite: they are those that struggle a lot in understanding sentences in our own native language and make plenty of grammatical errors.
We talk about 14-15 years old who have no passion for studying and are there only because school is mandatory, struggling with mathematics and logic.</p>

7978,1,7984,,10/02/2024 08:53,,5,504,"<p>I'm soon going to introduce product types (C <code>struct</code> and the like in different languages).
The audience is 17 year old with a long term goal in scientific studies, who have by now a very limited knowledge of programming, mainly only basic loops in C with integers and integer arrays.</p>
<p>I would like to motivate the need and usefulness of this concept, knowing that they're going to say &quot;but we like to do everything with our basic <code>int</code>s&quot;.
I would moreover like to propose examples that are interesting, realistic, and with a glimpse to theoretical aspects (I am going to tell them not too late that what we are doing is a cartesian product of the considered base types).</p>
<p>By now, my main idea is the classic points in the plane, maybe complex numbers.
It's very good for my goals (there are reasons why it's a classic), but it has the only disadvantage that the two combined base types are the same.
The risk is that, having them already been exposed to arrays, their first impression of <code>struct</code> is a needless complication when they could have easily used an array of length 2.</p>
<p>Of course there are all those &quot;real (accountant) world&quot; situations, where I put together a name and an age, or an item and a price and so on.
But the students are in science education, I'm not particularly fond of accounting and administrative applications, and most of all I would like to avoid the consolidation of the view that computer science is a tool for accountants.
Instead, I'd prefer something about science or computing.</p>
<p>There is also the obvious construction of a linked list in C, but it's too complicated for them: no pointers.</p>
<p>Put somehow differently, from another angle (their): why would I want to define a new type if I do not do software engineering? I can bring all my data in primitive and disaggregated form as I have done for years: the advantage of creating a new type is not worth the burden of having to learn things.
Where even is this advantage again?
(Writing this line I am remembering of blub language and how it's difficult to make these motivations even for experienced computer scientists, doing it for young students does not seem an easy thing, seen from here).</p>

two documents: <a href=""https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/curricula-recommendations/cc2005-march06final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Computing curricula 2005 report</a> and <a href=""https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/education/cs2013_web_final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Computer Science Curricula 2013</a>.
The latter, more importantly, lists the knowledge areas and their relative content that an undergraduate student in computer science should know.
The content of each knowledge area is divided in core-topics and elective-topics.</p>

<p>What I want to ask is:</p>

<p>1) What exactly are the knowledge areas? Are they the fields of computer science where Ph.D. students can focus their research?
If yes, then how about architecture and organization (AR)? Isn't it the knowledge area where only computer/electrical engineers can focus their research?</p>

<p>2) Is this curricula applicable worldwide or does each country have its own?</p>

<p>3) Some topics are elective. How can I study the elective topics I'm interested in since my university didn't have enough time and resources to teach them?</p>

<p>Today's students believe (and rightfully so) that a file is an icon-thingy in a folder or on the Desktop. They have some vague idea that there are files for images (JPEG, GIF, PSD, etc.), files for music (MP3, WAV), files for doing office stuff (docx, pptx, etc.), and maybe even HTML files. But they don't know what's <em>in</em> a file. That's where I kind of stumbled around for a few minutes because I didn't have a good answer prepared, nor a really good demonstration.</p>

<p>Looking back, I think I might have shown him what a text file looks like using a hex editor. Maybe also a simple image format such as PBM or BMP. I searched around on YouTube for a good video, but found pretty much nothing.</p>

<p>I am having significant trouble learning it, however. It is a very complex API with many essential details. These details, while useful, are not interesting enough in and of themself to reliably hold my attention for long periods, even if I put in significant effort. I find when I go through the <a href=""https://vulkan-tutorial.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">written tutorials</a> that I get very distracted by almost anything. </p>

<p>For example, when I was reading about its mechanism for selecting a GPU in a multi-GPU system instead of focusing on the syntax that I want to learn, I ended up thinking about all the implications of such a selection existing, compared to the fact that it does not in OpenGl. Distractions such as that end up drastically increasing the time that I need to spend on the reading, and skimming is not an option either as the details really are important. </p>

<p>There are also diminishing returns as my ability to use will power to remain focused diminishes much more quickly than I would like it to (I can only get through maybe ~10 pages of this reading in a single sitting while maintaining the focus that I feel is necessary.)</p>

<p>This problem is not unique to Vulkan. I had the same problem, but to a much lesser extent, when learning OpenGl. In that instance, I was able to find video tutorials that explained the necessary concepts very succinctly. This helped both because the explanations were more succinct, with only the necessary information (including theory when appropriate) to use the API (and I could look at written alternatives when I wanted more details). </p>

<p>When I attempted this for Vulkan, however, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHt5wcxIPcE"" rel=""noreferrer"">the only video tutorials that I could find</a> were both outdated and contradicted the text tutorials in a few places, making me very weary of using them as I may pick up bad practices or outdated Vulkan. Video tutorials also work well for me as they keep on moving even if I get temporarily distracted, thus pulling my attention back. When reading, if I get distracted I automatically stop reading.</p>

<p>I would also like to note that this isn't an issue of lazyness; I am willing to put in significant time to do it, but I find that my ability to focus is quickly diminishing. </p>

<p>As such, I ask: How can I learn Vulkan (Ideally, the advice will be applicable to other similar tasks as well) reasonably efficiently and how can I counter the described road-blocks?</p>

One idea would be to got deep into Lambda Calculus and talk about how LC does conditionals. My first goal is to distinguish between <em>continuous</em> versus <em>discrete</em>; and yet I've written a Lisp function that can't really be represented as any sort of normal math function e.g., <code>S(n) = M*n</code>where <code>M</code> is some sort of machine or constant that takes a stop number and turns it into a stop name. Any ideas how, yes, this is a function? Or is this just a misnomer, i.e., comp-sci using/abusing the term function. So yes, how is <code>sisubstops</code> really a function?</p>

Up to now, we have used some puzzles and games (like the 15 puzzle), labyrinths, exercises taken from some local competitions (logical, reasoning, counting, etc.). We have shown them a wide range of topics: sorting algorithms, recursion, very simple automa, trees and family relationships, countings, combinatorial examples, cryptography methods (like Caesar's cipher), etc. The primary goal is to let pupils being fascinated by maths, informatics and their several fields and applications. We would like to increase their creativity, reasoning and modeling abilities.</p>

Beyond the topics, anyway, I kindly ask you to share your experiences, what worked and specially what didn't, speaking in terms of didactics methods.</p>

The first lab will take place before the first lecture, so me and the other TA will partly be responsible for preparing the students to not resent this class they're forced to take. At this point, the students have taken an intro class with Python and a class on OO concepts in Java, and they might be taking a language-agnostic algorithms class at the same time.

A few times in my introductory programming course, I will mention this fact (that computer science is among the hardest majors), partly to set expectations that students will need to work hard to succeed.</p>

<p>At our university we have a system in place that allows students to submit their code and get feedback on whether or not they satisfy the functional requirements of the exercise.
This is excellent and works well for many of our courses, especially the introductory courses.</p>

<p>We also use it for courses that teach more advanced algorithmic concepts, focusing on run time. We have exercises that ask them to implement for example dynamic programming solutions in <span class=""math-container"">$O(n^2)$</span> time.
Currently we use the automated tests to check for the functional requirements and have some tests with larger datasets and a time out to hopefully distinguish between <span class=""math-container"">$O(n^3)$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$O(n^2)$</span> solutions.</p>

<p>Perhaps to nobody's surprise this system is not perfect, with some students optimising the wrong parts of their code to hand in an <span class=""math-container"">$O(n^3)$</span> (or worse) solution and get it through the tests. Thus for the graded assignments our TAs also check all of these by hand to make sure the solution is really <span class=""math-container"">$O(n^2)$</span> and they deduct some points if it is not.</p>

<p>My question is, do you know of systems or methods that can automatically check the run time <em>complexity</em> of code (in terms of big-O), rather than the actual run time (in seconds)?</p>

<p>In case this is relevant: the programming language used at our university is Java.</p>

I have a background in computer science and my colleagues tend to use the term <code>vector</code> to describe an array in programming languages like C or Java. I particularly HATE this use of the therm vector, since vectors and matrices are mathematical entities that can be added, multiplied and so on, while arrays and multidimensional arrays can't. I know that there are languages that these constructs exists, like MATLAB, but they don't exists natively in the most used general purpose programming languages. In Java there is an data structure called <code>Vector</code>, that is, in fact, a synchronized list that can't be added, for exaxmple. C++ also has a <code>vector</code> data structure/container in STL that is a list too and is not a mathematical vector.</p>

<p>I always explain this for my students, that some people call arrays as vectors and multidimensional arrays as matrices and that this is kinda wrong. I tell them that an array can be used to represent a vector, but that it is not a vector! The same for matrices.</p>

<p>Before the start of the semester I decided to present the algorithms as java code, instead of pseudocode. I felt that this would make the presentation more precise, and show the students how to put these algorithms to practical use.</p>

<p>My experience has been mixed. It seems like the problem is that now the students think that the various algorithms <strong>are</strong> the java code. They are complaining that, for example, I can't possibly expect them to know the counting sort algorithm, because how can they be expected to learn code by heart? So I am starting to understand the wisdom of using pseudocode.</p>

5995,1,6003,,24/10/2019 23:53,,8,879,"<p>Before I ask my question, some background may be apposite to provide context. Please indulge me.</p>

<p>At the institute I teach, our Intro to Programming. It involves a coverage of C language. We believe C is the most foundational and least verbose of most of the popular and heavily used modern languages, such as C++, C#, Java, Python etc. (you may not agree with our position, but that’s a discussion for another day). </p>

<p>Our institute trains people in various trades and skill areas including programming. We try to attract people to programming, by allowing them to take our Intro to Programming course regardless of what they registered to learn.</p>

<p>Our Intro to Programming class thus is a mix of different students from different backgrounds and at different levels of education (O’ level students looking to prepare for exams or learn a skill, under- and post grads, self-taught people, professional programmers crossing over to C who feel they need a sound foundation, our registered programming trainees etc.)</p>

<p>We attempt to give them sound fundamentals covering history of programming, basic concepts, variables, i/o, sequential, branching and looping constructs, doing maths with C, functions, data structures fundamentals, arrays and pointers. After covering up to arrays and pointers, we teach them C-structs. </p>

<p>My experience has been: the students learn up to arrays easily, get some trouble with pointers but get by after a lot of scaffolded and non-scaffolded exercises. However, when it comes to C-structs, it takes a lot of effort to get them to understand even the basic concepts of C-structure members and struct variables. They confuse struct members with variables and try to declare or access members the way they would an ordinary variable as I would show below.</p>

<p>Though I try to make the concept of structs as intuitive as possible, I run regularly in to this confusion in students. Consider this snippet below, as a typical example of what I use to introduce structs.  The example, struct <code>MyshoppingCart</code> has 3 members (<code>orangeNos</code>, <code>grainKgs</code> &amp; <code>meatKgs</code>) and 3 variables: my cart content for Monday (<code>cartM</code>), for Wednesday (<code>cartW</code>) and my cart contents for Sunday (<code>cartS</code>).</p>

<pre><code>struct MyshoppingCart   // struct definition
{
  int orangeNos;
  float grainKgs;            // struct members
  float meatKgs;
} cartM, cartW;     // struct variables declaration type 1

int main()
{
    struct MyshoppingCart cartS;  // struct variable declaration type 2
}
</code></pre>

<p>With a simple struct like this, students show three difficulties.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you tell them <code>cartM</code> and <code>cartW</code> in the example above are struct variables, they ask why then are they not declared inside as members like <code>int orangeNos;</code> and <code>double grainKgs;</code> If I explain they are not inside because they represent an instance of the structure, they get more confused.</p></li>
<li><p>If I try to explain different ways to declare struct variables i.e. method 1: right after and following the closing brace of the struct definition and method 2: inside main using the name of the structure as prefix, the confusion increases. </p>

<p>It takes lengthy explanation and many examples to get some semblance of understanding from many of the students.</p></li>
<li><p>When you get to accessing members of the structure and you tell the students, we can do this by using the dot notation as in:</p></li>
</ol>

<p>(Code example)</p>

<pre><code>cartM.orangeNos = 5;
cartS.meatKgs   = 3.7;
printf(""No of oranges in my Monday cart is %d\n"",  cartM.orangeNos);
printf(""Mass of Meat in my Sunday cart is %.2f\n"", cartS.meatKgs);
</code></pre>

<p>A student will just go ahead in accessing say <code>orangeNos;</code> to write something like:</p>

<pre><code>printf(""No of oranges in Monday cart is %d \n"", orangeNos);
</code></pre>

<p>You tell him/her it’s wrong and: All hell just gets foot lose! They… just…. don’t …. get it …..EASY! He/she gets more confused!</p>

<p>My Question is:</p>

<p><em>Are these difficulties symptoms of cognitive overload? Or what could be the likely problem?</em></p>

<p>I have tried questioning students, but I have not gotten answers that may give me insight to the root of the problems. </p>

<p>Has anyone encountered similar problems teaching C-structs and how did you overcome it; getting students to learn it like a breeze? Please share your experiences or even suggestions you think might help me make learning structs easier and less herculean for my students.</p>

6022,1,6023,,02/11/2019 21:51,,0,169,"<p>A younger friend of mine, a high school student I have been encouraging to take his Computer Studies class seriously, and possibly go for CS in tertiary education, brought this problem to me. He was given a term paper by his teacher in the course of which he had to discuss language constructs in programming. </p>

<p>Being a diligent student, he had done most of the assignment but wanted to impress his teacher in addition with a definition of the term language construct as used in programming. He showed me his jottings from books and on-line but complained he could not find definition he could quote or material simple enough to enable him create a very good definition of his own. In spite of this, he came up with and showed me his definition below:</p>

<pre><code>""a language construct is a part of a program that does 
      some special work.""
</code></pre>

<p>He wanted my opinion on whether the above definition will be satisfactory for his teacher. I was uneasy to say ok/not ok. I felt the definition was too fuzzy but I could not come up immediately with something more accurate YET WITH LANGUAGE SIMPLE ENOUGH to be at his vocabulary level! This is the dilemma. So I searched in the literature available to me, on-line too. I even read this thread on StackOverflow:</p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10057524/what-does-language-construct-mean"">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10057524/what-does-language-construct-mean</a>
and this one on Quora: 
 <a href=""https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-construct-in-programming"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-construct-in-programming</a></p>

<p>I got many explanations but no compact definition. I thought hard about it. I made no headway. I also found this definition from Wikipedia (which incidentally is the only one that came close to a compact definition of the term):</p>

<p>“A language construct is a syntactically allowable part of a 
 program that may be formed from one or more lexical 
 tokens in accordance with the rules of a programming 
 language. The term Language Constructs is often used as 
 a synonym for control structure, and should not be 
 confused with a function.”</p>

<p>However, the definition was full of jargon and bombast (""syntactically allowable"", ""lexical ..."") which were way over my friend’s head. Furthermore, the last sentence of the Wikipedia definition begged a question of what is and what is not a programming construct. Considering it, shall we say class, object, structures, hash tables and such are not programming constructs? </p>

<p>We tried to pick elements of the Wikipedia definition, translate it to simpler language and incorporate in my friend’s definition, and the result got verbose and so long, it lost the compactness of a definition. The target is to come up with a definition of the term programming construct” that is simple, within the vocabulary level of a high school student, precise enough to clearly delimit the scope of where construct starts and where it ends (so one can easily see what is a construct and what is not). I and my friend have discussed in the last three days on it and we seem to be getting into an intellectual quagmire: the more we try to step forward, the more intractable it gets.</p>

<p>I bring this here because we are teachers. As teachers, we are used to having to define basic concepts. I am hoping to get some precision and lucidity that AUGMENTS my friend’s definition and makes it more rounded. Lets help a serious young man who has done his due diligence and needs some scaffolding. Thanks people. </p>

<p>Just a lucid, compact and rounded definition at the vocabulary level of a high school student please. (I will ensure you are acknowledged in my friend's paper if your definition is not an extension of his, and is used by him).</p>

6034,1,,,06/11/2019 22:11,,3,93,"<p>I was reading this article “Ten quick tips for teaching programming” by Neil C. C. Brown and Greg Wilson at <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5886386/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5886386/</a>  It had many useful suggestions one of which was “Don’t just Code” which I deciphered as: in addition to making students write code, we can also make them look at code and make meaning of it or engage with it in some way that gets them to think computationally. One way to do this they suggested was using Parsons Problems (That one is new to me).  I quote them here:</p>

<pre><code>For example, a growing number of educators are 
including Parsons Problems in their pedagogic repertoire 
[20, 27]. Rather than writing programs from scratch, 
learners are given the lines of code they need to solve a 
problem, but in jumbled order. Reordering them to solve 
the problem correctly allows them to concentrate on 
mastering control flow without having to devote mental 
energy to recalling syntax or the specifics of library 
functions. They are also liked by learners; Ericson et al. 
 [28] found that learners were more likely to attempt 
 Parsons Problems than nearby multiple choice questions 
  in an e-book.
</code></pre>

<p>I looked up the researches referred to above as [20, 27]. The 20 reference at <a href=""http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2839509.2844617"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2839509.2844617</a> validated and extended the original Parsons’ research at: <a href=""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1151869.1151890"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1151869.1151890</a></p>

<p>They implemented their Parsons Problems as web based drag and drop exercise. I get the general sense of how to create Parsons Problems. I want to use them. But I work in a part of the world where internet service is expensive and sometimes erratic. Similarly with electric power supply. So I wanted to design a paper based or some non-computer-based, physical media form of Parsons Problems that does not require use of electrical power or web access. I want to begin to use them in my lab/revision classes. However the logistics of their construction and use on non-computer media is not clear and/or problematic to me.</p>

<p>One option I considered was using flash cards with codes written on them for students to rearrange in the correct order of the code. One challenge with flash cards is the bulk. For example, consider an Intro Programming Class with students from several departments as high as 70 or more. Suppose you need a set of say 8 flash cards carrying the code for one program.  For a class of 70 students, that would amount to producing 70 sets of 8 flash cards (i.e. 560 cards). Multiply this for say 300 some exercises for different topics and different programming subjects and you begin to see the challenge. There are resource constraints here. There is also problems of handling the bulk, and keeping the cards in good condition from one use to another etc.</p>

<p>Any ideas how one can produce non web-based Parsons Problems in some (preferably, physical/hard copy) form that is much cheaper, less bulky, durable and yet engaging for the students i.e. they don’t just write answers, they shuffle and move, and do some activity with the options?</p>

<p>When we had fight with flimsy Windows98 (or geek it out in unwelcoming linux, but that never was a mainstream thing) even for normal tasks, you had to have some basic understanding of what you're doing (or you got punished with crashes and viruses) and computers were seen as practical, but complicated machines.</p>

<p>Nowadays, way more people use computers everyday (and I'd theoretically put smartphones into that category), but everything is easy and appified and marketing makes you believe those things work with unicorn farts and magic. Everything even remotely technical gets hidden from users, there's dozens of mechanisms protecting you from all kinds of stuff and phones generally are a black box that you're supposed to just consume on.</p>

<p>So from my experience, most people are overwhelmed by even the most simple things, like working in a folder structure or the realization that you can use a keyboard to make the computer do things or that error messages can contain more than just <em>""Oops, something happened""</em> and that you should please read them before shouting for the teacher that <em>""It just doesn't work!""</em></p>

<p><strong>Now am I just having nostalgia or is my observation valid?</strong></p>

<p>I would suppose there should be some literature on this subject, but this is totally out of my field, and google scholar doesn't bring up anything useful when looking for <code>""computer literacy"" smartphones</code>. So I guess I'm mostly looking for objective literature on this subject.</p>

<p><em>And don't get me wrong, I don't want to go back to the time where computers where only mastered by the most 1337 wizards and win98 would surprise you everyday with a new fuckup. I love it that I have the power of all my trashed computers in my pocket and that I can simplify things that once used to be hard. And I'm aware that this simplification opened up a whole new world for a lot of people, but I feel like there's also some negatives associated with it, and I'd like to see what I can do to counter those.</em></p>

I would especially require scrutiny in the 'abilities' section of the script to see if the definitions hold true.</p>

<h1>Javascript History and Capabilities</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>JavaScript was created at Netscape Communications by Brendan Eich and his team in 10 days, in May 1995.
Its syntax and functionality were inspired by Java, Scheme, and Self.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Javascript was first named as Mocha, later renamed as LiveScript.
LiveScript was again renamed to JavaScript to gain popularity as the 'younger brother' of Java</p>
</li>
<li><p>JavaScript was meant to manipulate web pages by modifying the DOM to show, hide or change content dynamically</p>
</li>
<li><p>Is used for online form submissions and animations.</p>
</li>
<li><p>It is the Defacto client-side scripting language of browsers, a popular choice on servers as well.</p>
</li>
<li><p>ECMAScript is a scripting language specification standardized by Ecma International, it is a set of guidelines to design a scripting language. JavaScript is an implementation of ECMAScript</p>
</li>
<li><p>Javascript is a scripting language since it is interpreted by browsers and there is no intermediate compiled code.
Modern browsers now use JIT compilers to 'semi compile' it in order to optimize its execution</p>
</li>
<li><p>Javascript is single-threaded to minimize complexities with concurrency</p>
</li>
<li><p>In browsers and servers Javascript codes are parsed (read) inside an environment called Javascript Engine.
Javascript engine compiles it to machine language and instructs the OS to execute the instructions</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some notable javascript engines are</p>
<ul>
<li>V8 – in Chrome and Opera.</li>
<li>SpiderMonkey – in Firefox.</li>
<li>ChakraCore - in Microsoft Edge.</li>
<li>Nitro or SquirrelFish - in Safari</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Abilities</p>
<ul>
<li>can run multiple tasks simultaneously without blocking any of the tasks (Asynchronous)</li>
<li>can exchange data asynchronously with a server across a network (Fetch API or AJAX)</li>
<li>can react to user actions such as mouse click, keypress, etc (event handling)</li>
<li>can switch between tasks in a single-threaded execution (concurrency)</li>
<li>can make use of object-oriented concepts (prototype-based Object Model)</li>
<li>can manipulate DOM of the browser to change the display of the webpage</li>
<li>can store data locally on browsers (cookies, local storage, etc)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Restrictions placed in the browser for the sake of data safety</p>
<ul>
<li>Does not provide low-level CPU and memory access</li>
<li>Cannot implicitly access files or OS functions</li>
<li>users need to explicitly provide file access by input tags as well as for input device access such as camera and microphone, cannot access other tabs of the browser.</li>
<li>It follows the 'same-origin policy' wherein javascript from one domain cannot access resources from a different        domain if it doesn't have a CORS header</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Javascript running on the server side have full access to the file system, input devices, and OS functions. it does not follow      'same-origin policy'</p>
</li>
<li><p>Javascript Capabilities depend on the implementation of the javascript engine and the interfaces provided to it by the environment.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Other languages compile into javascript which is then parsed by javascript engines.
One such notable language is TypeScript which adds strict typing and object orientation.</p>
</li>
</ul>

Since we expect the number of students taking this course to grow in the future, we're looking at autograding to see if it's useful for us. In particular, we're looking at using <strong>Github Classroom</strong>. I have a number of related questions about this. Feel free to answer all or only some of them.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Autograding leans heavily on unit tests to grade, and these unit tests are in the students' repositories. This means students can work on their code until it satisfies all the tests, which would result in a perfect grade. What kind of assignment setup/grading setups are possible that aren't so all or nothing?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Can you stop students from altering files in the repository that they're not supposed to alter? For example, if their starter code contains a file <code>assignment.py</code> and <code>tests.py</code>, can you enforce that they only change the assignment file?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Is it possible to apply hidden unit tests, that aren't visible in the students' starter code repository? For example, we might want them to implement a ML algorithm, then test it on a dataset they haven't seen yet, to see if it generalizes well. Also, it would enable us to have a tamper-proof unit test (see point 2).</p>
</li>
<li><p>What are general issues to watch out for when using autograding for (some of) the assignments in a course? Or Github Classroom-specific problems?</p>

People in the other question suggested that it is the products that make programming enjoyable. But she is saying that she doesn't like the products either. She would rather solve problems by hands than to have a program that solves problems for her, because she thinks using programs to solve problems feels like cheating, and prefers to solve problems in a more elegant algebraic way.</p>

<p>The first incentive is that the course needs to provide a solid foundation, which includes understanding how things work under the hood and implies teaching pointer, raw array and string, dynamic allocation etc.</p>

<p>The second incentive is the focus on developing algorithmic thinking and taste for elegant code. This incentive seems to be served best by teaching the smallest and the simplest-to-use possible subset of the language sufficient to solve algorithmic problems, gradually getting to the level of problems used in informatics olympiads for high school. So, for example, <code>std::vector</code> would be taught instead of raw array and pointers would not be mentioned. This would probably also mean excluding the need to handle errors in the exercises, so as to not spoil the taste of writing short and elegant code.</p>

<p>Which approach is preferred? Or maybe a third approach?</p>

<p><strong>Clarifications following the reply by @Ben I.</strong></p>

<p>I am presenting this as a choice between two approaches, because I believe that the two approaches are in conflict. Low-level features of the language are complicated. To help students understand them, one needs to give a lot of technical examples and exercises. This totally takes the focus away from algorithmic thinking.</p>

<p>Also, I am writing under the assumption that, once I am convinced about the correct way of teaching, I can try to convince my colleagues to consider changes in the follow-up courses as well. Right now the curriculum is built on the first approach. The big picture that I see is that there are many CS graduates who know programming languages, but few who are good programmers. Look at the questions at <a href=""https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">leetcode.com</a>. Almost all of them are about algorithmic thinking, because employers are looking for good programmers.</p>

Who just completed their first year (just below bachelor level) which was poked full with holes due to coronavirus) with professionally-made similar sites from major companies (that most likely had more time, resources and knowledge going in).</p>
<p>I argued that when doing the projects we should keep the educational level of the student in mind, and can't expect high end stuff from them seeing they just got started (especially seeing that on paper they don't have any time to learn, but have to be &quot;productive&quot;). I have tried teaching them, but there are several wildly different projects and in the limited time I got with them I am not able to go by every project to give a proper in-depth course on how to best do it.</p>
<p>How could I convince my employer to ease up on the students, because in my opinion it was unwise to take on paid projects when you only got a bunch of first year college students to it in a rather limited time? And how could I advise him to simply say not take on so much work or such high demanding work when he knows that the skill level and time frame of the &quot;employees&quot; are so limited (because the next group is scheduled to start in February).</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>My employer has a small IT company, and the students are sort of his interns. My current job (three days a week at least) is to manage the students (although I have contact with the school/teachers, I am on the commercial side of the story). My job includes giving them their projects, and guide, advise, and supply them. But due to the coronavirus crisis they missed a lot of classes, so I spend most of my time (especially in the first weeks) tutoring them than anything else.</p>

<p><em>I live on the Dutch countryside, here there are several colleges/universities that offer IT degrees (post-secondary vocational education/ Bachelor Degree/Master Degree). But most of those students go west to the city after graduating, creating a knowledge drain on the region while there are companies here that are actually looking for new IT employees.
To combat this local companies (Both companies who do and do not have IT as a core business), Schools and the local government are banding together to create an IT-Hub to bring students and businesses together. In an attempt to keep graduates in the area and to lure more IT-based companies to our region.</em></p>
<p>Now here comes the issue, the IT-Hub is supposed to get assignments from the companies so that the students can work on them in a controlled environment. And although we got enough projects for the other fields (Design, web development, software engineering and so on) we are seriously lacking projects/assignments for &quot;IT-Management&quot; (IT-Management is stuff like security, server management, cisco, hardware repair and such).</p>

I'm not covering Makefiles and while I could find a bit of time to talk about build systems, the course is already pretty loaded (as any ""introduction"" to C++ can be).</p>

<p>The issue is that our school currently only supports Microsoft Visual Studio 2019, which is a behemoth and much too big for the tiny hello-world-ish stuff we need to do. It forces my adult students to go deeper into debt just to buy a new computer to run the thing.</p>

<p>It is also very complex and forces me to teach about managing Visual Studio's projects and files, competencies that are not really useful outside of Visual Studio.</p>

<p>I've been doing a lot of work with online tools (especially repl.it and onlinegdb.com), but our internet can be flaky and I would much rather have an offline tool.</p>

<p>Ideally, that IDE should be: </p>

<ul>
<li>Simple, so it is not overloaded with features we won't need,</li>
<li>Lightweight, to work on older computers,</li>
<li>Offline, for when the internet goes into molasses-mode,</li>
<li>Portable, since students use various versions of Windows, Linux and Mac.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am aware it is more of a wishlist and that there might not be a tool able to do all this.</p>

<p>What I've tried so far :</p>

<p><strong>Adequate match:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>CodeLite: Seems like a stable and up-to-date version of Code::Blocks/Dev-C++. Must install a compiler and debugger however, but it seems easy enough with GCC/GDB on Linux/Mac and Win-Builds' MinGW-w64 install on Windows. It also requires to add the executables to the $PATH environment variable on Windows. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Partial match:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Sublime Text: Lightweight and easy to use. Build system seems to be unique to Sublime Text however, but is not too hard to use. Nagware which require to pay for the official version.</li>
<li>Geany: Very lightweight, but not easy to use. Would require to teach Makefiles.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Bad match:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Code::Blocks: It is too unstable. It keeps crashing and students are confused whether their code is wrong or Code::Blocks is misbehaving again. </li>
<li>JetBrains CLion: Better than Visual Studio, but still heavy and complex to use.</li>
<li>Apache Netbeans: Current version (11.0) does not support C/C++.</li>
<li>Apple XCode: It is not portable outside of Mac. </li>
<li>Spyder3: Nice IDE, but really minded for Python.</li>
<li>Visual Studio Code: Too many complex configuration files, unique to VS Code. </li>
<li>Atom w/ gpp-compiler package: The IDE is added on top of the text editor. Error messages are difficult to read since they are on popups. Uses command-line GDB for debugging. The gpp-compiler package itself is still buggy.</li>

<p>It seems to me there have been a variety of schemes over many decades now, and all eventually seem to fall by the wayside.</p>
<p>Untrained novices seem not to be automatically drawn to such diagrammatic representations, and experts tend to shun them either as simplistic or as obscuring.</p>

<p>The said book seems to be quite popular and is followed as the text book in many colleges throughout the world. Even the amazon reviews of the said book is quite good. Now many people said me that the 3rd edition is better than the 4th edition and though the 5th edition of the said book is out now, I could get hold of a cheap used copy of the 3rd edition. </p>

<p>There is an introductory text pertaining to ""Computer Organization"" by the said authors, which is quite easy (and not bulky) and one can easily go through it without much effort as this very organization book starts from the very basics.</p>

<p>Now coming to my question. How should I read this book, <strong>Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach</strong> for the first time ? There are quite a few things I want to add, the book is quite bulky and the language and terminology (till the end of first chapter) is not quite easy as in the very first chapter of the book the author talks about things such as <em>trace driven simulation,embedded benchmarks</em> and so on, and I feel that the author assumes one is quite familiar with concepts,as is evident from the way the text is written in the first chapter. I have not yet started reading the second chapter. There are few more things, in each chapter the author talks about real life examples of the processors or the other hardware and gives a case study of the same. Though it is good for better understanding, but might be of more importance in the subsequent reads, after one has gone through the basics or the core sections in each and every chapter.</p>

<p>Now I want to know how can I read this very book for the first time, to build my concepts,(I want to sort of learn only the necessary and sufficient concepts of each and every chapter, in depth though in the first reading) and after having a more or less rough but deep idea of the content of the entire book, I want to read the book again in totality, reading the portions which I might have skipped in the first read. The above book is quite bulky (I am not afraid of that, had it been so, I would not even bought it) and chances are there that I might get lost till I read the book entirely. </p>

<p>So can a schedule be suggested to me, which I shall follow to read the book, I want a schedule or a routine, which I shall follow in a hardcore manner while my first read, with selected but important necessary and sufficient topics from each chapter and a well ordering of the same.( Sort of programming the playback of old video compact discs on VCD players,such that out of the many tracks only those are played and in the order in which I program my player).</p>

<p>I did not face such a problem while reading a textbook before, I have read many texts like Ullman's Automata, Tenenbaum's Data Structure, even Morris Mano's Computer System Architecture... <a href=""https://www.cs.utah.edu/~rajeev/cs6810/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">I have even gone through the lecture series by Prof.  Rajeev Balasubramonian to build the foundations which uses the 5th edition of the said text</a></p>

6816,1,6817,,16/02/2021 14:07,,2,220,"<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Hello, I am a third year undergraduate in CS. I am eager to pursue higher education from one of the best institutes in out country. For that I need to write a competitive exam, named GATE which had this <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/15m1czm6LIqRhskbqLPNvcfqY0ot_8ZdT/view"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">syllabus</a> for this year 2021. The syllabus remains more or less the same each and every year.</p>
<p>The pattern is as follows, 65 questions , time 3 hours.
So for each question, I can afford at most 2.76 mins, which is quite a constrained amount of time, considering the level of the questions.</p>
<p><a href=""https://pyq.ravindrababuravula.com/subjects/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This</a> is to give an idea about the level of the questions</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
<p>As per the given syllabus, the exam asks quite involving questions on Graph Theory, with questions based on properties of graph algorithms, tree formed by traversals, or coloring or other important but at times unseen (by the candidates) properties or concepts. Mostly they tend to ask questions from unseen topics, which probably one has not handled previously unless he is quite lucky. In such cases they definite the topics and then asks on them.</p>
<p>Usually questions are like select the most appropriate options or marking the true statements.</p>
<p>Now it is quite difficult (for me at least) to understand in 2.76 mins the new concept (defined in the question), read the statements, find counter examples for them to prove them wrong. At worse for some statements it might happen, that I am unable to find the counter example in that 2.76 mins of time, but it might happen that a more difficult counter example might exist.</p>
<p>One can have a look at the type of question in graph theory <a href=""https://pyq.ravindrababuravula.com/topic/?tp=Graph-Theory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> and <a href=""https://pyq.ravindrababuravula.com/subject/?cs=Algorithms"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> and <a href=""https://pyq.ravindrababuravula.com/subject/?cs=Data-Structures"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Situation/Request</strong></p>
<p>I have gone through <em>CLRS</em> and I am acquainted with the terminologies or graph theory algorithms and properties of tree produced by traversals etc. But the thing is that all these I have learnt, by going through the text many times and I have been quite slow at grasping those concepts given in <em>CLRS</em>.I have even gone to <em>Kenneth Rosen's Discrete Mathematics</em> texts.
As per the recommendations given in few coaching institutes (note that I do not go to any one of them, I do self study, got to know from my classmate), I have picked up <em>Narsingh Deo's Graph Theory</em> text and I am going through it now.</p>
<p>[I have solved most of the exercise questions of CLRS (except for the <span class=""math-container"">$\star$</span> questions) mostly on my own but only for once, long a ago, while reading the text for the first time. Some questions even took a single day to think (too slow indeed). Rosen has a huge no of questions at the end of each text, that too I have solved not all but selectively as I found few problems repetitive there, and that too I have done only once. But I have read the text many more times (that too selectively), so that I do not forget the things which I have learnt...]</p>
<p>Could anyone recommend me some good text or detailed video lecture series (not a very advanced one) that would help me to build <em>intuition</em> behind graph theory properties or statements unknown to me. The texts which I have already read are classic and fine, but I find it difficult at times to answer questions in the GATE, (might be due to the short time or might be that I am not that sharp) but still I want to sharpen my skills in dealing with these problems of graph theory. Even the weightage of this subject is quite high every year.</p>

<p>But most of the time, I have difficulty understanding the kinds of stuff in the book. Though the content is fine, and I end up asking questions on cs.StackExchange or StackOverflow. Then I thought of reading the reviews of the text and find out whether it is only me who is facing is the problem or there are people like me as well, finding the language hard to understand. Then I came across the <a href=""https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/703102.Compilers"" rel=""noreferrer"">review</a> page of this book in good reads and among many reviews, I found one which explains the problem with the text probably. Here it is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good content, horrendous writing.</p>
<p>The good thing about this book is it is comprehensive and covers a lot of ground from different vantage points. For example, the parsing chapters also cover the design of lex and yacc apart from basic topics. The type checking and runtime environment chapters had examples from C and ML to cover different scenarios.</p>
<p>Now the bad parts. The book is awfully written and I cannot understand how can a book in its 2nd (or 3rd?) edition continue to be so bad. It was shoddy writing throughout but the prize for the worst writing is these topics:</p>
<ol>
<li>Discussion of bottom-up parsing where they directly jump to deterministic graph without discussing the nondeterministic version.</li>
<li>Implementation of L-attributed SDTs with an obtuse parser stack.</li>
<li>Implementation of type unification with their shoddy graph data structure.</li>
<li>Implementation of run time system for ML using &quot;display&quot; which is incomprehensible.</li>
</ol>
<p>Another consistent problem is their horrible use of passive voice. This interacts really badly with their discussion of mathematical aspects. While the use of passive voice might be excusable, its shoddy use is not.</p>
<p>Reading this book often felt like deciphering some ancient text. I needed to translate a lot of obtuse writing into something that can be understood in my head. This translation happens for all readings involuntarily but it was alarming I had to consciously do it for this book.</p>
<p>I am not sure why is this book called a &quot;classic&quot; computer science book. It is more like a kind of book that students are forced to study by their professors. This book is impossible to read unless you are following some other source. I followed Prof. Alex Aiken's lectures</p>
<p>This book might be responsible for the unpopularity of the study and research in programming languages. I agree compilers are not easy but this book has taken a difficult topic and made it incomprehensible thereby doing a disservice to this whole field of study.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>I am not criticizing the text or authors. The only thing is that probably the text does not suit a self-learner like myself. Could anyone suggest a compiler text to substitute the red dragon book possibly? A book with easy language, such that one easily understand what the authors tried to mean just by reading a sentence once. This would help a self-learner to focus more on the concept rather than getting lost in finding out the meaning behind the lines.</p>
<p>A book that is lucid and easy to read and equivalent in power to the red dragon book as far as the contents and the examples are concerned.</p>

6495,1,6496,,30/08/2020 00:27,,26,4331,"<p>I have a background of 20+ years professional coding, but my heart is really in teaching. About three years ago, I started tutoring ages grade 6 through adult in coding topics.</p>
<ul>
<li>introduction to coding in Python or Java</li>
<li>AP CS A help</li>
<li>for independent students, long-term projects like an role-playing game</li>
<li>competitions (CodeWars, US Computing Olypiad)</li>
</ul>
<p>I like my code to be simple and comprehensible, with the feeling of confidence that it works... a simple thought process by which I can understand (and anyone can understand) what my code does.</p>
<p>So I teach that. I teach breaking things into encapsulated sections, I teach testing and debugging techniques.</p>
<p>I also teach how to make use of your brain better and work smart, not hard.</p>
<p>Several of my students have been with me for three years, and they've all grown a lot, and they're a pleasure to work with because they picked up this clean thought style.</p>
<p>But... is this the only approach to teaching? Is it the best approach?</p>
<p>Keep in mind that most of my students aren't going to be professional coders. Keep in mind that I'm a bit obsessive and probably could stand to lighten up a little and let my students work in whatever way they would like.</p>
<p>Recently a student came to me, interested in doing US Computing Olympiad problems. The thing is, he had barely learned anything about coding. He had a little Java knowledge, but was weak on creating classes and really didn't even understand how to use functions. I suggested that we work on fundamentals and he balked - from his point of view, you didn't need functions to solve these problems, and he had searched the web for other solutions and none of them used functions. (All the code is in main())</p>
<p>At first I figured he was in for a disappointment when he realized these problems were over his head. Well, shiver me timbers, he has solved about 10 problems so far using this technique. I can't even figure out what his code is doing or why it should work.</p>
<p>He doesn't do testing even! He just submits his code and keeps tweaking it until it passes the online judge test cases.</p>
<p>So I finally said that consider it a limitation on my part, I'm only really able to work in my normal method and that if he really doesn't want to do things my way, he has to find a tutor who can work with him like this.</p>
<p>Finally there came a reason why he's interested in me and my methods - he did see that it would be useful to test and debug, and he did find a few USACO solution online that used functions and classes, so now he has a mild interest in learning that from me.</p>
<p>I guess what I'm asking then, is when you are mentoring someone, how do you negotiate this balance between &quot;teaching them clean work&quot; and &quot;let them work in the method most natural to them&quot;?</p>

<p>Mostly my assignments are problems we find online, such as Codewars or USACO problems. This isn't the best way to teach them about large project issues, such as &quot;maximize cohesion, minimize coupling&quot; or clear structure and documentation.</p>
<p>When I had fewer students I did unique projects with each one, but that takes way too much time outside the session for me to prepare. So what I'm looking for now is some kind of project I can do with my students that would teach large project concepts.</p>
<p>This project may be fairly complex. But -- it should be the kind of complexity that my students can wrestle with on their own. I need to be able advise them on it in a one hour lesson.

6548,1,6551,,17/09/2020 21:59,,3,154,"<p>I'm a freelance tutor working with high school students, giving them programming assignments in languages like Python, Java, C++, and others.</p>
<p>In recent months I've seen the value of using English - getting them to write documentation and also to write down rough drafts of their algorithms in pseudocode. I'm wondering what other teachers do with this. (I'll give an example with an Euler problem.)</p>
<p>The goal is to get them to think at a high level. Typically they like to dive into code. It's not concrete to them if they aren't writing code. I get it, developing a higher-level understanding is something that takes time. But I think I need to push it a little - they are just avoiding pseuocode and documentation past the point when they are really ready to use it.</p>
<p>One obstacle is their general writing abilities. The students who don't write well in any context, like English class, find it the hardest to write documentation and pseudocode.</p>
<p>To give an example, let's consider Euler 46, &quot;Goldbach's other conjection&quot; <a href=""https://projecteuler.net/problem=46"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://projecteuler.net/problem=46</a></p>
<p>This project involves testing different ways of adding squares and primes, in some kind of nested for loop. Typically they want to start out with details like</p>
<pre><code>for (int n = 0; n &lt; ???; n++)
{
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; ???; i++) 
    {
        for (int j = 0; j &lt; ???; j++)
        {
            ??? generate square and prime S and prime P ???
            if (2 * s + p == n)
                break; // and do what then ???
        }
    }   
}
</code></pre>
<p>Where I have put question marks is where they aren't sure what to put. But they begin wrestling with each place I have put question marks right away. That means they are struggling with low level details right away before they really understand the gestalt of the problem. Also they will throw in a <code>break</code> without having considered ahead of time how that will play out.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to get them to do is write pseudocode like this:</p>
<pre><code>For every N, an odd composition number we are testing, in some range
    For every prime P &lt; N
        if N - P is not twice a square, we found an exception. print or mark it
</code></pre>
<p>Of course this is a big leap, so I guide them to it gradually. (The benefits of working as a tutor and not a classroom teacher.) When they think at a high level, they can also see choices available to them. like maybe that pseudocode could be modified to be made more effcient.</p>
<pre><code>For every N, an odd composition number we are testing, in some range
    For every value 2 * S where S is a square
        if N - 2*S is not a prime, we found an exception. print or mark it
</code></pre>
<p>They can reflect on the difference long before they have wrestled with the details of for loops. They can think about how they might efficiently test if a number is prime. Maybe they've seen before this idea of generating a hash set of primes and think about whether that's faster than trying to find out if a number is a square (which requires a sqrt operation).</p>
<p>Then there's documentation. The difference between something low level like</p>
<pre><code>// set i to 0. increment i and stop when it's n 
for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
</code></pre>
<p>and higher level like</p>
<pre><code>// loop over possible test values (i)
for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
</code></pre>
<p>What I'm looking for from the answers is whether other teachers have found it useful to bring English into helping them develop higher-level understanding. &quot;Chunking&quot; concepts for example (thinking with high-level or abstract concepts). And how successful is this? Does it depend on a student's ability to use English in the first place?</p>

6401,1,6403,,24/06/2020 16:26,,5,218,"<p>In short: Does learning how to make software, have its place inside universities? If so which parts of it?</p>
<p>I was studying in a university in Russia. I don't want to name its name and location. I wanted to become a software developer. Following some people's advice I entered a faculty that was mostly about math. All its teachers are mathematicians. So most of our subjects were just different kinds of math. There also was some programming but much less. I was told by other students and teachers that how I pass Calculus and Algebra exams was the most important thing and that programming exams were unimportant at all. Many different teachers and students were saying that &quot;a university does not need to teach programmers&quot;. They say that &quot;it's not science&quot; and &quot;it's nothing but craftsmanship&quot;. During a defense of diploma people sometimes ask programmers something like &quot;That's all interesting but that's not math so why it's a diploma work?&quot;</p>
<p>When I talked with people who were actually working as software developers they were saying that &quot;If you don't how to fix problems with Linux and don't know a single architecture pattern then as a programmer you are really nothing&quot;. They also said that &quot;I wouldn't hire a developer who doesn't tell me that HP-UX is a bad OS when I mention it&quot;. In university we spent a single lecture on patterns(and not even all students but some) and none on Linux and other operating systems. And I knew literally nothing about HP-UX. I had to learn 90% of my skills myself via books, online-tutorials and documentation.</p>
<p>In our country IT is a very popular industry. Because of that the math faculty students are 90% wannabe programmers. Teachers really hate that as they want math to be popular again. They say that &quot;computer science ate math&quot;(That's citation of a teacher during a lesson, &quot;Информатика съела математику&quot;). The teachers despise us programmers. The employers in Russia prefer candidates with a degree but will gladly accept those without it. The students try to pass all exams only to have the degree, they don't care about subjects at all. They forget everything when they come out of a room after an exam. It's seems like students and teachers declared war against each other.</p>
<p>I left university without any degree. Now I work as JS-developer. I myself participate in interviews to hire new developers. I ask them about things like Single Responsibility Principle, how to write clean code and how to create indexes in SQL. I know that SRP is not a law of physics, it comes without a good scientific proof. But I need it from by workers.</p>
<p>The question is how do Universities in other countries approach teaching software development? Do they actually target it? Is actually becoming a real software developer that will be respected by employers and not a scientist is a valid goal for a university student?</p>

6431,1,6432,,16/07/2020 16:45,,4,301,"<p>In our Bachelor curriculum the course Operating Systems and Computer Networks (5 CP) is designated to be taken in the second semester.  Currently it uses C, and while I'm personally very fond of C, it does usually overwhelm the students to learn C enough in order to be able to complete the practical exercises.</p>
<p>However, the focus of the course is not to learn a language but rather the concepts and applying them in small exercises, while getting a &quot;feel&quot; for operating systems or low-level development.</p>
<h1>Issues with C and Rust</h1>
<p>Issues students had with C:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading the documentation / man-pages: They're often written for much more experienced people.</li>
<li>Self-teaching C: It's difficult to find resources both understandable and 'to the point' and 'correct'. Most C only resources, often top hits on Google (e.g. geeks4geeks), are simply wrong  code.</li>
<li>Dealing with undefined behavior.</li>
<li>Dealing with complex and difficult-to-understand error messages by the compiler.</li>
<li>Compilation of the program.</li>
</ul>
<p>A few of these issues could be addressed with Rust:</p>
<ul>
<li>The documentation is excellent.</li>
<li>Online-Tutorials don't need to be perfect as with C, since the compiler is pedantic enough.</li>
<li>There's no/less undefined behavior.</li>
<li>The toolchain is easy to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other languages and their issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python is a popular choice, however I had bad experiences with students being unable to verify their code correctly since it's never compiled and the missing type system can be daunting sometimes as well. Also it often creates a bit too much abstraction in order to be able to look 'into' things.</li>
<li>Go was used in some advanced courses here for networked programming or parallel programming.  It has nice tooling as well but targets a different kind of abstraction as well.</li>
<li>C++ is simply too complex, while improves some areas of C above, it does so without really removing the pitfalls of C.</li>
<li>Java has similar issues as Go and Python here.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Rust Low-Level Abstraction Library</h1>
<p>However Rust has many abstractions that actually stop us from being able to really 'go down' the stack and look 'into' what's happening (at least, without understanding the details of Rust which isn't the goal).  For example for the students to fiddle around with syscalls they are supposed to write a small cat(1) program using open,close,read,write(3) etc.  There's of course the <code>libc</code> crate but using that basically requires knowledge of C and Rust to really deal with things.  I thus drafted a small library which I currently host <a href=""https://git.imp.fu-berlin.de/koenigl2/ti3-rust/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> with really thin abstractions around those syscalls that make dealing with them from Rust quite nicer. <sup>1</sup></p>
<p>The code logic is now quite similar, but hopefully the easier tooling helps the students:</p>
<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>ssize_t n = read(src, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
if (n &lt; 0) { return 1; }
if (n == 0) { return 0; }

const size_t read = (size_t)n;
</code></pre>
<p>Becomes:</p>
<pre class=""lang-rust prettyprint-override""><code>let read = match read(src, &amp;mut buffer, BUFSIZ) {
    0 =&gt; return 0,
    n if n &lt; 0 =&gt; return 1,
    n =&gt; n as size_t,
};
</code></pre>
<p>And similarly</p>
<pre class=""lang-c prettyprint-override""><code>while (remaining &gt; 0) {
        ssize_t written = write(dest, &amp;buffer[read - remaining],
                                remaining);
        if (written &lt; 0) { return 1; }

        remaining -= written;
}
</code></pre>
<p>is now:</p>
<pre class=""lang-rust prettyprint-override""><code>let mut remaining = read;
while remaining &gt; 0 {
    let written = match write(dest, &amp;mut buffer[read - remaining..], remaining) {
        n if n &lt; 0 =&gt; return 1,
        n =&gt; n as size_t,
    };
    remaining -= written;
}
</code></pre>
<p>I also think it's far less confusing for students to have &quot;return values&quot; to be separate from program &quot;exit codes&quot;.  However I'd like to hear some opinions or get some feedback whether you think this is worth pursuing.</p>
<p>For those wanting to try this, in <code>Cargo.toml</code> add:</p>
<pre class=""lang-toml prettyprint-override""><code>[dependencies]
libc = &quot;0.2&quot;
ti3-rust = { git = &quot;https://git.imp.fu-berlin.de/koenigl2/ti3-rust.git&quot; }
</code></pre>
<h1>Remaining Issues</h1>
<p>Some things are lost when using Rust.  Since <code>cargo</code> now handles building, the possibility to learn about (Preprocessing) -&gt; Compilation -&gt; Assembly -&gt; Linking is lost.  While the goal is not to be CLI compilation magicians, I think understanding this pipeline does help to reason about certain OS behavior.  However one might rightfully argue that this is simply too in-depth for a 5 CP second semester course anyway.</p>
<hr />
<p><sup>1</sup> However this library should not be used in the real-world as it simply wraps the low-level functions in the libc with <code>unsafe</code> blocks and does some ugly casting.</p>

6547,1,,,17/09/2020 09:21,,5,511,"<p>I am working for a company, and a target for this year is to increase the level of CS knowledge among the staff.</p>
<p>The company does mostly engineering stuff so the people come from an engineering background, they might have some knowledge of programming, such as what is a variable, control flow, etc. but classes are virgin territory. That is kind of the average level there.</p>
<p>Me and a few others with knowledge (formal CS background, working in the AI team of the company) were assigned to increase the level of knowledge in the office. Basically each mentor was assigned a handful of mentees and the mentor decided what to teach and what exercises to give etc. to improve the algorithmic thinking and C++ competency.</p>
<p>I paired up with a colleague and we pooled our mentees. For some people it worked great. People went from variable names like <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>ok</code>, <code>x</code> and thousands of lines of copy-pasted code in <code>main()</code> to actually nice variable names, class hierarchies with abstract classes/interfaces, clean code to the point where (almost) no comments were needed, etc.</p>
<p>I tend to think that we are doing something right, especially since my colleague and I also teach at our university (which is among the top3 in the country), create training materials, held multiple training sessions on different subjects, regularly mentor interns with great success and also did volunteer work tutoring middle school children in introductory programming, with parents at the end asking us to continue the tutoring for money. So we are not exactly new to teaching, and our experiences seem to indicate that we are not bad at it either.</p>
<p>However I have a student that doesn't seem to grasp some concepts at all even after multiple (&gt;5) explanations using different methods and analogies. Will also forget basic techniques in the span of hours.</p>
<p>For example he needs a copy of a <code>vector&lt;int&gt;</code> (C++). He will do the old song and dance:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>vector&lt;int&gt; copy;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; my_vec.size(); i++)
    copy.push_back(my_vec[i]);
</code></pre>
<p>We told him several times and explained why it was better, faster, prettier to just do:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>vector&lt;int&gt; copy = my_vec;
</code></pre>
<p>He always forgot to do this for his homework until we made his homework to clean up his code and implement a single utility function.</p>
<p>He cleaned up the code, then in that utility function went right back to the <code>for</code> method. And when we pointed this out it took a couple of minutes and helping questions for him to realize what he did wrong.</p>
<p>Another example is that as a first project the mentees have to implement a basic Hill Climbing algorithm.  This project has been given in June. We have people who will begin implementing Genetic Algorithms this week and it won't even be hard for them. People who have started from variable names like <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>ok</code>, <code>x</code> and thousands of lines of copy-pasted code in <code>main()</code>.</p>
<p>Without precise instructions he's barely able to create functions like with 1-2 rounds of review &quot;you get a vector of vectors as an argument. compute <code>f</code> on each of the vectors and return the index of the first vector where the value of <code>f</code> is above some threshold <code>x</code>&quot;.</p>
<p>The hill climbing algorithm was explained exactly 7 times to him in different ways, with both me and my colleague actually spending time to come up with new analogies. Every time this mentee will enthusiastically say that this time he understood better than all the other times and then do something like just compute the best neighbor of the starting point and return that neighbor, and then name the function <code>firstImprovement</code>.</p>
<p>The problem is that this person does not appear disinterested. When we explain things he nods and looks like he is concentrating and that makes us try again and again because it looks like he's trying too, but the issues above have been a thing for months. On a problem as simple as Hill Climbing.</p>
<p>Has anyone ever had such experiences? Any advice? Or any other site where this question would be appropriate?</p>

<p>Two generic Data Structures implementing the Dynamic Dictionary Abstract Data Type are &quot;(2,3) Trees&quot; and &quot;AVL Trees&quot;. Such a dynamic dictionary data structure implements (at least) the methods insert(key,info), search(key), remove(key,info). When teaching those, in order to simplify, save space and draw examples quicker, one can omit the &quot;information&quot; part, hence reducing the dynamic dictionary abstract data type (ADT) to a dynamic set ADT. This generates some minor technical differences:</p>
<p>A. inserting the pairs (10,A), (20,B), (30,C) in a dictionary (2,3) Tree yields a tree of height 1, with the pair of keys (20,30) at the ternary root separating 3 leaves coding for the 3 pairs (10,A), (20,B), (30,C); while</p>
<p>B. inserting the keys 10,20,30 in a set (2,3) Tree yields a tree of height 2, with a binary node (20) at the root, separating two binary nodes (10) and (30) [separating 4 empty leaves, if this makes any sense].</p>
<p>I find solution B a bit confusing to me (albeit I can cope with that) but, more importantly, confusing to undergraduate students, who end up learning how a search tree works without understanding why it works this way. I am wondering if it is an example of simplification making it (voluntarily) more complicated, or if there are reasons (e.g. practical applications) to study search trees with information (or pointers to information) along with the search keys in the internal node.</p>
<p>Notes: Obviously  enough,</p>
<ol>
<li>Splay trees SHOULD have the information (or pointer to it) along with the search keys in the node; and</li>

<p>I am currently working with a university to design an online Machine Learning and Cloud Computing course. We are closely following <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1492032646"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hands-On Machine Learning</a> by Geron. The author of this book has created many useful Jupyter Notebooks with examples that follow the text.</p>
<p>I have been creating new Jupyter notebooks by supplementing his example Jupyter notebooks with paragraphs and bullet points excerpted directly from the text. The plan is to make instructional videos that work through the notebooks.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>Could any of this be construed as plagiarism? Obviously, I'm not suggesting to the students that I am the author of the notebooks. I am completely transparent that the notebooks are based off Geron's textbook and supplementary materials.</p>
<p>Is this ok? What's the best way to be transparent if it is okay to proceed down this path?</p>

<p>My next goal is to teach them object-oriented concepts and if possible give them some &quot;real&quot; examples to try themselves. But most of the materials I find (most of google's top search results) about OO programming (not just python) are laden with poor examples, if I may say so. I really don't like to use car/vehicle or animal/dog to teach them the OO concept and OOP.</p>

<p>---- update ----</p>
<p>I find the python logging module is another good example, but it seems too complicated for non-experienced programmers.</p>
<p>When using the logging module we mainly use 3 objects, <strong>Logger, Handler, Formatter</strong>. Logger is the <strong>facade</strong>, as <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#loggers"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#loggers</a> said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Logger objects have a threefold job. First, they expose several methods to application code so that applications can log messages at runtime. Second, logger objects determine which log messages to act upon based upon severity (the default filtering facility) or filter objects. Third, logger objects pass along relevant log messages to all interested log handlers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Handler is a good example to use <strong>inheritance</strong> <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#useful-handlers"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#useful-handlers</a> and handlers use formatters, which hide the complexity of LogRecord, to the format log message.</p>
<p>In addition to these classes, there are a number of <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#module-level-functions"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">module-level functions</a> for convenient use.</p>
<p>Overall it is a good example of using <strong>composition</strong> and aggregation.</p>
<p>But I am not an expert on the python logging module, I hope someone who is familiar with the python logging module may add an answer to my question.</p>

But how to convey these ideas to high school students or non-experienced programmers is another challenge,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a “part” construct that can protect it's inside from its outside, and
vice versa</p>
<p>a “communications” construct that can convey interactions and deal
with dependencies</p>
<p>a “system” construct that is a combination of parts and communications
that can fit in a part recursively, and everything is made this way</p>
<p>the “messages” that are communicated are also in terms of the systems</p>
<p>the system that is being made is made with the same kinds of system
...</p>

<p>The recent log4j security flaw made me come back to my own although my question has nothing to do with log4j. I know python logging module is <a href=""https://realpython.com/python-logging/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">adopted from Log4j</a>, so I think this can be used as a good example to how different programming languages borrow the idea from each other.

I would rather recommend &quot;Code Complete&quot;(or &quot;Clean Code&quot;) instead of some book for a specific programing language.</p>
<p>My first question, how do you interpret this book list? I feel they are poor recommendation/assigned books for a mediocre college in China (I can say this with confidence as I am Chinese)</p>
<p>My second question, what is your recommendation? The goal is to help them keep interested in CS. If the reading can help them better prepare for their undergraduate study that is a plus. When thinking about my recommendation I reread Paul Graham's &quot;Hackers &amp; Painters&quot;(he talked about his high school life in the book) but I found I didn't enjoy reading it this time.

<p>The comment from &quot;njuffa&quot; mentioned &quot;Programming Pearls&quot;. There are couple of reasons I didn't consider &quot;Programming Pearls&quot;.</p>
<ol>
<li>I try to avoid c++. I believe c++ should not be kids' first or second language. As a matter of fact I will advice them learn c++ until they absolute must, say a job/project requires to use c++.</li>
<li>If I remember correctly the book is mainly about algorithm, but then we already have enough books for algorithm, e.g. I would rather recommend &quot;<a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1617292230"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People</a>&quot; instead of a book in 1999.</li>
<li>I normally don't recommend any &quot;old&quot; book for my students, (whether we should still read &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot; can be another topic) but this lead to my next point.</li>
<li>&quot;The Pragmatic Programmer&quot; 1st version also published in 1999 but I see it has a 20th Anniversary Edition. I don't read this new edition. So if you read this new edition will you recommend it to undergraduate student ?</li>
<li>I am thinking about recommending books about Operating Systems because they heard these terms iOS, watchOS, macOS all the time. But I can't find an easy one. Most books about Operating Systems are too thick and I believe they will study OS theory in college, so I just need some easy(interesting if possible) introduction material.</li>

point where they can make a mobile app, a fancy website, or a complete
system. That isn’t “I can’t code” and is instead “I don’t know what’s
expected of a new software engineer.”</p>

<p>As a computer science major myself, I can tell you firsthand that
computer science involves writing very little code — especially at the
higher levels. If I had to arbitrarily assign a percentage to “math v.

and at most 20% programming.</p>

<ol>
<li>Different tools for different jobs. Many languages were invented and developed for specific needs(even though through their evolution they are all able to solve some common problems).</li>
<li>Big tech companies invented their own programming languages to solve specific problems, java, c#, go, Swift to name a few. These languages have their own goals and priorities, which are not in line with existing ones.</li>
<li>People love to invent new things and programming language is no different. People often say &quot;Each language has its own unique characteristics that would make it suitable to solve a particular problem.&quot; But I would like to put it another way, each language bears the characteristics that come from their inventors's experiences/strengths/lessons learned with the languages they used before.</li>
<li>People have different tastes, personal preferences, or philosophies, when they don't like language A, they invent language B. <strong>I will emphasize this one to my students.</strong> When I search answers to this question I don't see many mentioned this. But think it is an important reason. For example, I hate C++, to me it is an ugly language. I read somewhere (I can't find it now), golang inventors don't like C++ too(same as Java inventor I think), so they invent their own languages.</li>
<li>Technology is evolving. So people and big companies always feel the need to design a new language to better harness the new technology. The latest example of this may be <a href=""https://www.modular.com/mojo"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mojo</a> although reading its introduction I can't help saying WHY and again?!</li>
</ol>
<p>The list is no doubt not exhaustive (and they overlap) but I try to make them not be too pedantic or too boring. For example, I particularly stay away from the reasons like &quot;different programming languages are based on different programming <strong>paradigms</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>Quantum Computing is regarded as one of the most <em>disruptive technology</em> as well as <em>emerging technology</em>[1,2]. This field has attracted a lot of computational startups and investments in the recent years[3, 4, 5]. With such a pretty new field to learn and work on lacks some material/online courses to self learn Quantum Computing from Computer Science and Engineering perspective. So, the question focuses on the good quality resources to/for:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Self-Learning Quantum Computing to build Quantum Computing Simulations on a digital Computer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Development of software, programming of such computer systems.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hardware and Physical implementation from the perspective of CS Engineers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Deployment and Integration (hybrid systems) with Digital Computer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Related areas of disruption of cryptography, internet, data, AI, etc.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>The answers may be answered in the forms of links/resources to - scientific articles, papers, online courses/videos and Books that can aid or teach self learner Quantum Computing.</em></p>

6995,1,6996,,29/06/2021 06:49,,6,179,"<p>I'm looking at ways to improve assignments and reduce the amount of grading. Previously, there were two in-person lab classes with 15-20 students each week. Since Covid, there is now one online lab class with 40+ students each week. This course builds off a previous course where students learn basic Java programming (if statements, while loops, I/O, methods, and objects) and lead up to a more advanced course on data structures and sorting algorithms. It's meant to teach students object-oriented programming in Java by going into concepts such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Object-Oriented Design Principles</li>
<li>JavaDoc</li>
<li>Inheritance &amp; Polymorphism</li>
<li>Exception Handling</li>
<li>GUI (Swing and JavaFx)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are currently 6 Java programming assignments (each worth ~2.5% for a total of 15% of their final grade). In each assignment, the student is expected to build a fully functional program that basically creates objects from and saves the objects back to a database (text file, random access file, and MySQL). The last 3 assignments build off of each other (I'm not sure if this should be kept or not).</p>
<p>Another question was asked on how to automate grading (<a href=""https://cseducators.stackexchange.com/questions/1205/how-can-i-automate-the-grading-of-programming-assignments"">How can I automate the grading of programming assignments?</a>) and the top answer suggests JUnit Testing, however, my students aren't introduced to JUnit testing until one of the last modules. I'm not sure if the Auto Grader is an option either because of our very limited budget, the size of the assignments, and pushback/criticism from other educators.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li>Larger class sizes, less class time.</li>
<li>Completely online instead of face to face.</li>
<li>6 large assignments with half of them building off of each other.</li>
<li>Students aren't introduced to JUnit testing until the end of the course.</li>
<li>Auto graders seem out of reach.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>How can I reduce the amount of grading for the assignments?</li>
<li>How can the assignments be improved?</li>
<li>Any other feedback to improve the assessments?</li>

She will spend hours on Khan Academy, using their javascript/processingjs environment. This is educational, but it's not a toy or a visual/drag-and-drop interface; it's raw javascript, with a bit of help from the compiler (in the form of a cartoon character that says things like &quot;are you missing a semi-colon?&quot;).</p>
<p>Since I'm the programmer in the family, I've been working with my niece to develop her interest, and I'm unsure how to go about it further. She wants to develop video games or animations, so she'll look at programs that other people have written, but these are generally big and hard to follow. What she can do on her own is find individual lines of code that she can understand, like a call to <code>fill(color)</code> and she'll change the color, or <code>rect(x,y,width,height)</code> and change the parameters to change where the rectangle is drawn.</p>
<p>When I work with her, she'll ask for features, and I'll implement them and explain, and she seems to follow the explanation, but she can't generate the code herself, or understand how to decompose a complex task into pieces small enough that she can implement them, and then assemble the pieces into what she wants to build</p>
<p>I'm wondering if there's a curriculum or toolkit out there that would guide a child--slowly--through the skills. AFAICT, the Khan academy system isn't really that kind of thing, more like an environment and some tutorials, and access to other people's code, but not a linear course to follow.</p>
<p>I'm thinking of something like <a href=""https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Python Like You Mean It</a>, but for kids, and ideally oriented towards graphical output--something that the child could follow along in a linear way, to provide structure to her studies.</p>

<p>I chose the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">subset sum problem</a> since it can illustrate different paradigms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given an array <span class=""math-container"">$A = [a_1, …, a_n]$</span> of positive integer values, and a target <span class=""math-container"">$T$</span>, is there a subset <span class=""math-container"">$I \subset \{1, …, n\}$</span> such that <span class=""math-container"">$\sum\limits_{i\in I}a_i = T$</span>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The algorithms I chose are:</p>
<ul>
<li>brute force testing is interesting because students must iterate through all subsets;</li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem#Pseudo-polynomial_time_dynamic_programming_solution"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dynamic programming algorithm</a> is a classical pseudo-polynomial time algorithm;</li>
<li>even a (non-optimal) greedy algorithm can be worked on if we consider the optimization version of the problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>My question is about a divide-and-conquer algorithm. I couldn't find anything about it, so I thought about a way to do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>If <span class=""math-container"">$n = 1$</span>, answer <span class=""math-container"">$a_1 = T \vee 0 = T$</span>, if <span class=""math-container"">$n = 0$</span>, answer <span class=""math-container"">$0 = T$</span>;</li>
<li>Otherwise, if for any <span class=""math-container"">$t\in \{0, …, T\}$</span>, SSE has a solution for <span class=""math-container"">$[a_1, …, a_{n/2}]$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$t$</span>, and a solution for <span class=""math-container"">$[a_{n/2+1}, …, a_n]$</span> and <span class=""math-container"">$T-t$</span>, answer True;</li>
<li>Otherwise answer False.</li>
</ol>
<p>One of the problem is that the time complexity is quite ugly to compute. I found the relation:
<span class=""math-container"">$$C(n, T) = \sum\limits_{t=0}^T\left(C\left(\frac{n}{2}, t\right) + C\left(\frac{n}{2}, T-t\right)\right) + \Theta(1)$$</span>
I am not sure about the solution, but I found <span class=""math-container"">$\Theta(n^{1+\log_2 T})$</span> but it might be too difficult to compute (however, this is a practial session, so computing time complexity formulas is not the main objective). I finally found out that by memoizing, the algorithm can reach a time complexity of <span class=""math-container"">$O(nT)$</span>, which is the same as the DP algorithm.</p>
<p>Currently, I have worked with students on the binary search and square-and-multiply algorithms. A future class session on mergesort and quicksort is already planned (as well as different classical examples for dynamic programming).</p>
<p>Have you seen the previous algorithm (or something similar) anywhere? Do you think this algorithm (and the session overall) is relevant? If not, do you have any suggestion about another interesting problem for a 2h practical programming session?</p>

It is <em>very important</em> when discussing some data structures and their use in algorithms since worst-case analysis is sometimes quite far from the actual behavior.</p>
<p>My question is: Where is an amortized analysis used, <strong>not</strong> related to data structures?</p>
<p>Two points to clarify what I mean by <em>not related to data structures</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Amortized analysis can be used to analyze <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kruskal's algorithm</a>, but it is very much related to data structure: the amortized aspect is related to the <em>union-find</em> data structure.</li>

I consider that this is amortized analysis not related to the data structure.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, the border between <em>related to data structure</em> and <em>not related to data structure</em> is probably ill-defined. A more precise version of my question could then be: What are examples of amortized analysis of algorithms, that are least related to data structure?</p>

In many textbooks such as <a href=""https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-fourth-edition"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>the CLRS</em></a>, three methods are presented: aggregate, accounting, and potential. My question concerns the links and differences between accounting and potential method, and was actually inspired by questions from my students.</p>
<p>In the accounting method, one has to define a <em>money cost</em> for each operation, and show that at each step, the account contains enough money to pay for the actual cost of the operation. Otherwise stated, one needs to show that the account always has a nonnegative amount of money. To formally prove the nonnegativity of the account, a possibility that I like to present to my student is to relate the amount of money on the account with some quantity in the problem: For instance, for the amortized analysis of a binary counter, one can prove that the money on the account is always twice the number of <code>1</code> in the counter at each step.</p>
<p><strong>My question:</strong> &quot;My&quot; proof technique makes the accounting method very close (almost identical) to the potential method. The money on the account defines more or less a potential function. <em>From a pedagogical perspective</em> (which is what I am interested in, of course), what is the best solution?</p>
<ul>
<li>Present both methods as completely distinct, and maybe avoid &quot;my&quot; proof technique;</li>
<li>Present both methods separately and show that they are two ways of presenting the same idea;</li>
<li>Present the potential method, and then the accounting method as a way to define a potential function;</li>
<li>Something else...</li>

odd and even ASCII character codes.</p>

<p>I am now thoroughly convinced that while loops fall into this class, as they are clearly conditional branching. In a longer course they might take a class on themselves, but since I've got eight classes I'd rather include them in this one and take the next one on for loops and lists than simple-mindedly slicing &quot;loops&quot; into its own class, as I feel somewhat inadequate to state that &quot;there are two kinds of loops...&quot; as I often read or hear.
This opens a lot of room for creative exercise scenarios. For instance offering a recurring menu could lead to fun name-composing.

They had 8 weeks during which I was always available for consultations. In addition to that, I have scheduled some extra time for students to consult their ideas, implementation and ponder over some of their problems.</p>
<p>Majority of the submitted projects were of a quite high quality. However, some of them used tools that were neither covered nor are particularly advised by the external sources. On the contrary, actually.</p>
<p>For example, one of the students (out of ~1000) used a bunch of <code>goto</code>s. We are teaching Modern C++ and we have never covered <code>goto</code>s during the laboratories. They were briefly <em>mentioned</em> during lectures, but it was more of a &quot;we don't do that here&quot; comment.</p>
<p>Another submitted project was covered with <code>#region</code>s. As far as I am aware, even in C# it's no longer a practice.</p>
<p>During the course we have frequently commented on the importance of code quality, not merely the solution being functional. During the defense of the project I took my time explaining why such approaches are undesirable, but I was not convinced about the course of action regarding the grade. A part of the grade was being dedicated to code quality and usage of proper tools. The students knew it the whole time. While I <em>could</em> see some negative points being assigned for using <code>goto</code> since it was mentioned in the lectures that students should not use that unless there really is no better way of achieving the desired goal, I am really unsure what to do about <code>#region</code>s or other obscure approaches that do not apply to C++.</p>

Creating a list is boring, so I opted to introduce something that you can do with lists, but requires some thinking: swapping. I introduced it by putting out four pencils in a row, like this. I asked them to swap the second and fourth items in the array (in reality).</p>
<pre><code>| | | |
</code></pre>
<p>They took both their hands, picked up the second and fourth pencils (each in one hand), and swapped them! That works in reality... but isn't right in computer science. So, I told them, try doing it with only one hand. Predictably, they couldn't. I introduced a temporary spot, where they could put one pencil. I was hoping they would do something like this:</p>
<pre><code>Second Item -&gt; Temp spot
Fourth Item -&gt; Second spot
Temp spot -&gt; Fourth spot
</code></pre>
<p>They figured it out. But they asked me something like this: &quot;Why can't I use two hands?&quot;. I wasn't sure how to answer that. The obvious answer is... <em>the computer only has one hand</em> (this was <a href=""https://scratch.mit.edu/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Scratch</a>, so multithreading didn't exist). But...

I try to tell people calmly to read the documentation for whatever it is they are trying to use - but this often doesn't resolve the issue even when it seems like it ought to. Sometimes a direct link is needed (with an anchor to the appropriate part of the page); perhaps a relevant quotation, or even my own rephrasing or explanation.</p>

Given that multithreading has really only come into its own in the past 20 years or so, since the advent of multicore processors, I'm wondering if anyone knows the rate at which multithreading became a standard subject covered in programming modules (i.e. the implementation and analysis of small multithreaded programs, as opposed to the high-level study of it in an OS architecture module, for example).

7412,1,,,14/05/2022 18:43,,6,412,"<p>There is a school of thought that it couldn't matter less which programming language is chosen as one's first programming language. The official position of a well known internet community dedicated to programming is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>No programming language is designed to be beginner friendly.</li>
<li>One will not use their first language to develop things worthy to be published, instead one will only use it to learn basic concepts, therefore arguments such as &quot;<em>to do X you may use Y, but A is instead used to do B</em>&quot; only provide cognitive overload for beginners.</li>
<li>There is no reason to believe that the choice of the first programming language impacts the effects of learning in any way, so the whole discussion is groundless. (Mods say they will only consider differing opinions on this point if scientific papers are brought to support them)</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the said online community bans asking questions like &quot;<em>Which programming language should I pick to learn how to program?</em>&quot; and if such a question is asked then it bans giving any answer other than &quot;<em>It does not matter; pick absolutely any, flip a coin if you like, and stick to this choice</em>&quot;.</p>
<p>Intuitively I find this position surprising? I would say that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some languages have significantly more gotchas than others. C or C++, in particular, have numerous unobvious rules which, if violated, result in UB. It can easily happen that a program starts misbehaving after a seemingly innocous modification in code is made because of hard to spot UB introduced somewhere else. This seems to be a horrible and a very frustrating experience for beginners.</li>
<li>A person interested in doing a particular thing might want to be able to scratch their first, even very rudimentary programs in this field. For example, contrary to what is claimed above, a person interested in doing gamedev might be far more interested to scratch their first simplistic games in Unity3D than learn lots of stuff that is too abstract and too unintersting for them because due to the lack of domain knowledge they chose ASM as their first language (since they were not told which lang is good for gamedev, but instead they were told to pick any random language).</li>

<p>I am talking about the users who are doing the math in answers. It is not joke math, it is serious math that is too tough for me to understand.</p>
<p>I am undergraduate student who is graduated from college. But we never had to do such theoretical questions in college. It was mostly numbers based instead of formulas based. And we didn't learn to do such proofs even though we did study theory of computation. We didn't have to prove a lot of dangerous looking things in that subject as well. Instead it was included for few marks and we were supposed to write the gist of that (rather than proving them).</p>
<p>We did discrete mathematics as well and we never had to study about such stuff. It was about graph theory and stuff, and our exams never tested us on deriving something, nor did the teacher's slides focus on it.</p>
<p>But this is really making me hurt that I don't know what almost everyone knows in CS.</p>

7444,1,,,06/06/2022 23:14,,3,69,"<p>I have recently been reminded again (through lots of pain) why I wanted to do my masters in CS instead of mathematics. Its not that I can't do an MSc in mathematics, its just that I don't enjoy analysis or geometry at all, and my development in those two fields have been very slow. On the other hand, I am in love with combinatorics and graph theory, and have done a lot of research projects (individual reading) in graph and hypergraph theory, this is why I think a CS MSc would fit me better.</p>
<p>However, back in March I decided to do a math MSc, since the tuition fee for a CS MSc is ~5 times the tuition for a math MSc. My idea is to hit as many classes in theoretical CS as possible, and barely take the required math classes.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is it a sane (possible gotchas, looking for unforeseen problems) decision to focus on CS classes in a math MSc? (in other words, I <em>want</em> a CS degree, but circumstances dictate that I enter a math program)</p>
<p>My own considerations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>While I do not enjoy mathematics that much, I am still strong in it, apart from geometry. I'm hoping that I can keep on developing/using my probability theory or combinatorics. I will not be hindered by abstract algebra either.</li>
<li>Apart from graph theory, I almost have no CS background. I have been doing extensive projects with pandas, and used a lot of MatLab for my thesis, but that is about the extent of my programming skills. I don't know how to use any technologies (I still don't know how to properly use requests, still can't figure out how to multithread properly, only a partial understanding of SQLalchemy).</li>
<li>I don't know if this is just a temporary case of 'grass is greener next on the other side'.</li>
<li>I have seen massive improvements in my math skills between the first, second, and third year. Though somehow I'm still skeptical that I actually understand anything apart from graph theory.</li>
<li>Were I to do this, I would pick mostly machine learning classes (there aren't that many OpRes classes in the univ I will go to, otherwise I would focus on it instead). I'm very skeptical that machine learning is something you learn in two years. I'm afraid of being in the same situation as I have now, having only theoretical understanding of things (I'm finishing a BSc in pure maths, the kids doing physics are better in calculus then I am).</li>

7460,1,,,23/06/2022 17:58,,5,321,"<p>The situation of students in these countries is terrible. In paper, every information for CS is available in paper. And it's correct for 70% of content. Mainly the content available that is of high quality for free are &quot;textbooks&quot;. That too thanks to those great sites that I can't name here. Nobody from these countries even in their dreams would be able to afford even a single textbook for 1 subject if they had to pay the prices for it.</p>
<p>I am blaming nobody for this whole situation, not even government. The blame game is meaningless and doesn't give anyone anything.</p>
<p>The teaching is horrible. Nobody wants to stay in these countries. So what do the students do? They graduate, maybe with a good gpa. Their ultimate goal in the mind is to do GRE, and study in USA and settle there. They don't seek for any other jobs. They just apply for teaching in the college that they studied in. This is about 30% of the teachers.</p>
<p>Then there is no research facilities available (except just for the name). So it doesn't attract people who would like to really deal with the subject. Rather a different set of people that you can understand what I am saying.</p>
<p>I don't blame any teachers. They have been taught by teachers similar to them. The quality of teaching is atrocious. For a moment, I would assume teaching is subjective and discount them on that. But their slides preparation is dangerous. They go to google, search for the &quot;abcd-slide&quot; and download the first google search. Don't even give credits and edit their  own name on it. Voila, you made  a slide.</p>
<p>Don't even imagine about complaining anything to management. I know friends who got failed because they asked for extra classes of a professor. Supposedly the ego of professor was too big.  Nobody can do anything, because it is university and rightly so, teachers have huge amount of power.</p>
<p>I don't have problems with slides. In my terrible journey of learning computer science in this country, slides in internet were my best friends that I could never meet. In the sense, that they are very rare. It is  very easy to understand stuffs written in a slide compared to what is written in textbooks. Obviously. I want to clarify this that I don't have problem with slides as many students in this region actually have started to think &quot;slides are the problem&quot;, and if the teachers taught in whiteboard/blackboard, everything will be fine.</p>
<p>Yes there are MIT, NPTEL to name a few. But firstly our course evaluation was so different from what is taught there, secondly, most students could never follow what's being taught there. They of course were the best minds of USA, India etc, there is zero doubt about that, but the target students of those courses were maybe not us. Even when we learnt something totally and watched those courses, it would still confuse us.</p>
<p>The only best friend of us have been those textbooks. And honestly, having to download 50 different textbooks and read 5-10 of them for finding 1 information is really inefficient way of learning and I am not sure if everyone in the world is doing the same. If they are, it would feel comforting haha.</p>
<p>There are articles in internet for sure. But there are two types of articles-:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Written by companies</p>
</li>
<li><p>Written by random users</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Those written by companies do offer some value even though most of them are prefer to teach in higher level abstracting the details required for computer science but those written by random users are mostly copied from the same source and the quality is nowhere compared to textbooks and depth of information is lacking. A good site out of these is &quot;GFG&quot;. It is very decent compared to whatever is available online.</p>
<p>Most of us had no idea what a good class would look like until we found an online course of some great teachers. Luckily they were pretty cheap and affordable. We learnt what we were really missing that day. And honestly, there is no way a student from these countries would ever even catch up a serious student from those countries I'm talking about even though &quot;it's CS&quot;.</p>
<p>There are forums for learning. But the thing is we can never use this forum to learn MISSING cs concepts. Because forums have quality standard. They want quality questions. And in no world, a guy who don't even have a textbook that is designed for his university course and examinations(or any reference material) is asking a great question. And questions of these people is never suited for these forum. The literal question most of the times becomes &quot;where can I find this information&quot; &quot;what is this question  called&quot; &quot;where can I find explanations for this example&quot;. And rightly so, these questions are removed and these questions must be removed to keep the quality standard of site to the highest level. Nobody owes anyone anything and we aren't complaining that to anyone.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is also helpful for some of the concepts for sure. Specially it's helpful when you already know the fundaments and just want to look for extra reference. Eg-: you already know about certain algorithm but you want to see some exceptional cases. I don't think it's a great source of learning material for learning something for the first time.</p>
<p>Another wonderful source of information can be research papers. But most research papers seem to be teaching something additional i.e if you are learning about MPLS for exam(hypothetical), they are teaching a modified MPLS technology and talk little bit about the original MPLS. And it is well researched fact that research paper are extremely technical in nature(not sure if technical is the right word, books are also technical but they are easier to understand, want to say that research papers aren't easy to grasp).</p>
<p>Then youtube, you can't forget it. It's good and decent for understanding surface level materials.  There are lots of videos for sure but they are not very satisfactory. And nobody should blame anyone for not providing the best materials for free.</p>
<p><strong>Any information is better than bad or information.</strong></p>
<p>Then there are some sites like udemy that provides paid courses. They weren't even available in this country since a long time.(There was no payment method). One course that we did there was lifechanging. Everything was easy when there was proper guidance. You could spend time on extra learnings, proofs, theories that are in research papers when you understood what's taught easily. There might be other sites but their pricing is just too big that nobody is going to be able to pay. (As there are no part time jobs in these countries, forget part time jobs even qualified and talented people are jobless).</p>
<p>Since there is no official textbook for exams point of view and syllabus point of view. And since they have kept some topics in exam that honestly can't be googled and found anywhere, and which gets skipped by professors and their slides, it is just terrible terrible environment for students.</p>
<p>Sorry if this became a rant, but I am trying to get some constructive thoughts about these situation. We don't need advice as me and my friends have graduated or near graduation already.</p>

<p>What study techniques besides active recall, repetition(and those general study tips found in Ali Abdaal's youtube video) are useful to actually understand &quot;tough concepts&quot;.</p>
<p>Some methods I've devised so far:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start with exercises on textbook and study in order to solve them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Study in Iteration Based Model. Example study chapter 1 in first iteration. Skip some topics. When you come back after ending the current iteration by studying every chapters to next iteration, you again study chapter 1's skipped topics.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<li><p>distributed systems, computing and algorithms</p>
</li>
<li><p>database management systems</p>
</li>
<li><p>operating systems</p>

</li>
<li><p>computer organization and architecture, embedded systems</p>

<p>I feel hopeless and feel that &quot;I will never be able to learn&quot;, which is mainly due to my lack of belief in techniques to learn. I know this might be slightly off topic, but I want to note this point.</p>
<p>I love computers science and I've brought tons of books to study computer science, ranging from dbms, os, computer network, security, distributed systems, computer graphics etc. I recently thinking of purchasing a book on linear algebra as I feel math is the foundations for the most stuff in computer science.</p>

7524,1,,,04/09/2022 12:22,,2,100,"<p>rI am a teacher in germany (high school) and I am searching for algorithms, that solve interesting problems using no data structure or linear data structures only. The goal is to motivate the students and to show them use cases which are not artificial. The algorithm need to be easy to understand and should be explainable/programmable in one (or two) lessons.</p>
<p><strong>What should be exluded</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Algorithms that sort/search, because this is educated seperately.</li>
<li>Algorithms using a tree or graph data structure, because these data structures are only for advanced courses.</li>
<li>Algorithms that need more than one (or two) hours to teach.</li>
<li>Algorithms which are &quot;classic&quot;. Meaning I am searching for not so well known algorithms.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What I have so far</strong></p>
<p>The following german page <a href=""https://algo.rwth-aachen.de/%7Ealgorithmus/liste.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Algorithm of the week</a> has some very interesting algorithms. I like especially:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Algorithm 6: Pledge-Algorithm for finding the exit of a Labyrinth. Perhaps this is too complicated. The movement of the &quot;roboter&quot; is easy, but one has to prepare the labyrinth software and the students program only a part of the software. Therefore the students need to get along in an already programmed code, which might be too difficult.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Algorithm 13: Explaines the computation of the ISBN of books (error detection code). This algorithm does not need any data structure.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Algorithm 33: Detects in an election, if some person has over 50 % of the votes using a stack only. The algorithm is quite clever and does not count the votes for each person.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Algorithm 36: Schedules a tournament of n teams (n even) where each team has to play against all other teams. The algorithm does this in the minimal amount of rounds (n-1) and in each round there are n:2 parallel games. This can be implemented with a queue or a list.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I also like Algorithm 41 (simulated annealing) but this may be too difficult, it depends on the problem. I don't like the use case &quot;traveling salesman&quot; this is too artificial, because the distances between points are &quot;flying distances&quot;. If one takes real places - e.g. from the area the stundents know - on a map, then it gets to complicated, because only strees can be used.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I also like Algorithm 42 (smallest circle containing a set of points), it is randomized and very clever, but the implementation would be far too difficult.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following book was suggested: <a href=""https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Algorithms 4ed by Sedgewick and Wayne </a></p>
<p>I try to explain, why this is not exactly what a I am searching.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Chapter I: Everything is abstract here, there is no context. The data structures are there but they are not used to solve anything. I really like the 3-Sum problem, for teaching nested loops. But also, here is missing the context. What is beeing solved with 3-sum? Out of my head would be the smallest circle of a set of points. But this is still no context. The context would be &quot;there are houses on a plane and the people are arguing, where the new hospital/fire station should be build&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Chapter II: Sorting --&gt; I excluded this.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Chapter III: Searching --&gt; I forgot to excluded this, its educated together with sorting.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Chapter IV: Graphs --&gt; I excluded this, because its a beginner course. I really like to teach dijkstra, breadth-first-search, etc... there are many cool real life examples.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Chapter V: Strings --&gt; Nothing there I see, which has a nice context. Many algorithms there need trees/graphs. Although I favour Huffmann-Encoding. Implementing it is really hard. That would be possible at the end of the course (3rd year).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Chapter VI: Nice! But for my course, way too complicated. I will have a look at &quot;Particle Collisions&quot;. I am teaching quite early the collisions against the &quot;wall&quot; (only horizontal and vertical). But the collisions against other particals would be interesting.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To clarify: I am searching for a good <strong>problem/context</strong>. A particle collision would be still an abstract algorithm. The problem/context would be for example: Simulating how a virus distributes.</p>
<p>Thank you for your ideas/help!

I want to learn everything properly because I feel I didn't learn to the extent that I could in college. My first hitlist is operating system and Database Management System as these two are also little bit used in my job(Linuxadmin job that requires some bit of sql)</p>
<p>What's the best book about operating system? In college I read tanenbaum and hated every pages of it because it didn't go to much handholding that I wanted. I am weird because I want handholding in book that assumes I've no preriquisites while teaching. I don't need to make an operating system. Just clear my fundamentals and become an operating system knowledgeable person. Likewise I read computer networks by stallings and I was quite meh about it. The book was good in pieces and definitely better writing than tanenbaum but I'm not exactly impressed.</p>
<p>I've tried the book &quot;Linux with Operating system concepts&quot; and didn't find it good. I'm a hands on person nowadays so would love a book that has good exercises. When I say hands on, I don't want books that teach Linux. I already know Linux commands. I explicitly want to study the operating system fundamentals like process synchronization, memory management, secondary storage working etc.</p>
<p>The other book is by Galvin. But silber something also wrote this and I didn't like his DBMS book.</p>
<p>​There was 1 good book when I was in college I don't remember. If it was 3 easy pieces or something. It had dinosaurs in it. Probably galvin book.</p>
<p>Anyway, recommend me? I will also purchase a competitive exam practice questions book for GATE which is the toughest exam for engineering computer science.</p>

My subjects in B.A. are: Political Science, Economics, Sociology. Mathematics, Political Science and Sociology offers very little job opportunities, as far as I have found. By seeing this world, I got this belief that due to globalisation and ubiquitous nature of Computers, no one can find himself jobless if he has any <strong>degree</strong> in CS (I’m not sure if knowledge alone is helpful, because it is not in my country).</p>
<p>I would like to make transition from Mathematics to Computer Science, but I don’t know the way. I have tried looking up the various fields of CS and found that we can broadly classify them as under:</p>
<ol>
<li>Developers</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Data Analysis</li>
<li>Theoretical Computer Science</li>
</ol>
<p>Most of the courses in CS make people a developer or a data analyst, and a relatively less number of people go in security field (these are my findings, and they maybe not completely right). Theoretical Computer Science seems more like “the one less travelled by”.</p>
<p>I’m no longer 15 or 16 years old that I can simply pick up any of thousands of resources available teaching Python or C++. I have already given my 2.5 years to B.A., and 6 months more to give. I cannot afford to do any course in college for more than two years after this.</p>

Maths might take me <em>into</em> Computer Science and then I shall use it in the field of Economics. As per my knowledge, only financial institutions (like stock markets) seem to be using CS.</p>

<p>I've a bachelors degree in computer science. I didn't do it as well as I'd have liked to do, but that degree has gave me familiarity with most terms used in basic programming.</p>
<p>I spent last 2.5 months working on web development(I'm learning MERN). I learnt html,css,bootstrap, javascript and react till date(In bootcamp), but I failed to learn React. Even javascript, i'm no expert at. Even css, I learnt the basics but I'm not an expert when it comes to building half decent sites. Same for bootstrap. I can carve a site using html,css,bootstrap but it won't look good. I was completely  impossible to learn when it came to react. Whenever I saw usage of useEffect and useState hooks and we start making changes in 10 different files for it, it confused me and I understood nothing.</p>
<p>I had access to world's best resources to learn books, tutorials, blogs, youtube, udemy etc. I had access to forums like this to get help and support but still this was tough for me.</p>
<p>I feel unlucky, sad and hopeless atm. Friends who were weaker than me in conventional college studies and academia have done jobs and internships but I'm failing to even learn something properly. I'm not jealous of them but just feel trash about myself.</p>
<p>People say do projects to learn but I really don't know how that works. For eg: <a href=""https://codepen.io/pelko/pen/MWBpNmL"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://codepen.io/pelko/pen/MWBpNmL</a> This project. I make stupid stuffs like these and can't produce a good output that is playable. It's too hard for me.
These are some of my projects.

<p>I did all these projects without looking any tutorials.</p>
<p>I keep forgetting how I built something time and again. I nowadays try my best to add documentation though.</p>
<p>I'm 70% sure to give up programming but still I&quot;d like to make sure I follow advices from fellow forum users about it who've spent their life around programming.</p>
<p>In 3 months, I am seeing no progress, except few days like:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>When I carved a site on my own using html,css without looking tutorials.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When I carved a site on my own using bootstrap without looking tutorials.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>My problems:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I've not break through'ed in programming. If I can make anything with javascript that's over 500 lines of code, I'd consider that a breakthrough. I'm aware LOC aren't a good metric but please try to understand what I'm trying to say. A big application using programming.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Even in css, I failed to make presentable sites. The coding bootcamp I feel is going too fast as well. Same for bootstrap, I made sites but I failed ot create beautiful sites. People recommend me frontendmentor.io but IDK what to do there? It looks sketchy to me. If there is something that can teach me css, I'd be so grateful.</p>
</li>
<li><p>After watching tutorials, I can't repeat what they've done in tutorial without watching the tutorial of project even though I understand each and every step they do in project.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I still am not fluent in ES6. I can't think in ES6. Arrow functions, map, reduce etc. I Understand them, but using them is different ballgame.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you understand my situation, please guide me. I don't need roadmaps, any more tutorials but plain old guidance and advice on what to do by people who went through this situation</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Suppose we have a game program with Dogs and Puppies. A Puppy may have
some special attributes and methods that a Dog does not have. Over the
course of the game we may want our variable &quot;rover&quot; to be able to
point to a Dog instead of a Puppy.</p>

<pre><code>Dog Rover = new Puppy(&quot;Rover&quot;);   //case 1
Puppy Rover = new Puppy(&quot;Rover&quot;); //case 2
</code></pre>
<p>In both cases Puppy extends Dog.  Other than the reason stated in the
original post are there any use cases where case 1 allows us to do something
that case 2 would not?</p>
<p>It seems in the answers provided (certainly for the
ones using an ArrayList) we can add to the ArrayList either case 1 or case 2
and have the same functionality.  In other words, there is no inherent
advantage of one case over the other.</p>
<p>Whether we use a Dog variable or a
Puppy variable we will still access to the overridden methods, and since a
Puppy is a Dog we may add either to a ArrayList.</p>

to play &quot;Rock, Paper, Scissors&quot;. I think it is necessary to explain the difference between return and print here.</p>
<p>After this I will introduce <code>for</code> loops and use it to print the numbers from o to 100 or something similar. Then I will teach the accumulator pattern to solve katas like this <a href=""https://www.codewars.com/kata/57a049e253ba33ac5e000212"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.codewars.com/kata/57a049e253ba33ac5e000212</a></p>
<p>In the end I will introduce <code>while</code> loops, because it is the most difficult concept.
The students can solve katas like this with while loops: <a href=""https://www.codewars.com/kata/563b662a59afc2b5120000c6"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.codewars.com/kata/563b662a59afc2b5120000c6</a> and

<p>I am a teacher at a secondary school in Germany. Some of these students specialize in computer science.</p>
<p>Maybe I am the teacher of one of these courses next year</p>
<p>The students have to learn these basic concepts in the first year:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>variables</p>
</li>
<li><p>constants</p>
</li>
<li><p>types</p>
</li>
<li><p>operators</p>

<li><p>IO</p>
</li>
<li><p>GUIs</p>
</li>
<li><p>exceptions</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>They also have to learn these OOP concepts</p>
<ul>
<li><p>objects</p>
</li>
<li><p>classes</p>
</li>
<li><p>constructors</p>
</li>
<li><p>attributes</p>
</li>
<li><p>methods</p>
</li>
<li><p>encapsulation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the second year, they learn about</p>
<ul>
<li><p>inhertiance</p>
</li>
<li><p>interfaces</p>
</li>
<li><p>polymorphism</p>
</li>
<li><p>associations</p>
</li>
<li><p>overloading and overwriting of methods</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the students have no prior experience in programming. There are only two or three students in every class that learned to program in their free time.</p>
<p>In another parallel course, they learn some basic C.</p>
<p>Teachers at this school and on a lot of other schools use Java to teach these concepts.</p>
<p>I also think that Kotlin and Python are good beginner languages. I think the advantage of Python, is that it looks very friendly and you can use simple editors like Thonny for it.</p>
<p>The advantages of Kotlin are the type system and the C-like syntax. Unfortunately you have to use InteliJ for Kotlin.</p>
<p>I really like functional languages like Haskell and OCaml but they obviously don't fit to these OOP concepts.</p>
<p>I am very interested to hear your opinion about the best language for such a course.</p>

7816,1,,,11/07/2023 14:56,,6,75,"<p>I am preparing an educational course on software legacy code and refactoring. Every topic is introduced as a group discussion to establish the vocabulary. It is then followed by a matching practical coding dojo with a kata dedicated to the same topic.</p>
<p>The target audience is a group of software engineers who are comfortable with the principles of coding dojos, they have completed a half dozen of dojos already. They are experienced with applying TDD to katas where the objective was to write new code from scratch.</p>
<p>The new course is focused on working with legacy code: getting it under test, isolation of dependencies, safe refactoring etc. One of the topics I want to explore is that removal of code that is no longer useful is a valuable approach when working with legacy code.</p>
<p>I am looking for ideas and inspiration for designing a matching kata. I.e. I need to prepare a body of code and formulate an assignment for it. One of the feasible solutions to this assignment should involve removal a significant portion of the original code.</p>
<p>There are many catalogues on the web of ideas for katas and even ready-made repositories to be used as starting points. But I am yet to find one that would closely match my intention.</p>
<p>Most of the katas that start from a pre-existing non-empty code repository expect a student to transform it to a repository of a roughly the same size. I am looking for ideas where the resulting code is notably smaller compared to the starting point. The reasons for the initial volume could be different and combined in the same project: plain old copy-paste abuse, violation of YAGNI principle (having features that nobody asked for), various code smells that provoke code bloat etc.</p>

7845,1,7850,,01/08/2023 02:55,,0,67,"<p>Request to vet the evaluation for given two grammars, handling
arithmetic expressions, having two precedence classes of operators:</p>
<pre><code>addop= {+,-}, mulop = {*,/}, 
</code></pre>
<p>such that:</p>
<pre><code>precedence(mulop) &gt; precedence (addop)
</code></pre>
<p>My intent to introduce this example was to show how the C compiler, uses the <em>left-to-right associativity</em> to process a smallish arithmetic expression, as shown below:</p>
<pre><code>200+300+400-50*10/5*2
</code></pre>
<p>Also, wanted to show the same expression processed under right-to-left associativity.
This was to give a suitable small (<em>though irrelevant example, as the C compiler follows only left-to-right associativity for these four operators</em>) example, as the C compiler also has many operators where right-to-left associativity is followed.</p>
<p><em>But, still have to search for good examples for those operators, as well as to search for different examples, for more levels of precedence , than just two; as the C-compiler has 15 levels of precedence.
Hence, request for sources for the same too.</em></p>
<p>For the case of left-to-right associativity, have a small parsing grammar:</p>
<pre><code>expr -&gt; expr + term | exp - term | term
term -&gt; term * factor | term / factor | factor
factor -&gt; factor digit | digit
digit -&gt; 0|1|2|...|9
</code></pre>
<p>This grammar is also fit for BUP (bottom-up parsing), as left recursion is not a problem for BUP.</p>
<p><em>Though not needed, but it gels in the class to state that, the C-compiler is based on BUP.</em></p>
<p>In the absence of latex skills, to draw binary trees; have shown the similar effect, by the order imposed by the enclosing parenthesis:</p>
<pre><code>((200+300)+400)-(((50*10)/5)*2))
=&gt; 900 - ((100)*2)
=&gt; 700
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Right-to-left associativity</strong>
The corresponding grammar is:</p>
<pre><code>expr -&gt; term + expr | term - expr | term
term -&gt; factor * term | factor / term | factor
factor -&gt; digit factor | digit
digit -&gt; 0|1|2|...|9

What is overwhelming in specifically JavaScript is the large number of seemingly disparate ways of doing the same thing. Like functions. I've identified three ways of declaring functions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Classic: <code>function &lt;name&gt; ( &lt;param&gt; ) { &lt;body }</code></li>
<li>(fat) Arrow: <code>const &lt;name&gt; = ( &lt;param-list&gt; ) =&gt; { &lt;body }</code></li>

</ol>
<p>As I tend to use and push the module and encapsulation traits in JavaScript I also want to go with the latter but omitting the keyword <code>function</code> makes it less transferable to learn other languages. Number 2. has it benefits (immutable and used for anonymous or lambda) and pitfalls (no hoisting) and 1. has the clear advantage of looking more like other imperative and oop languages and makes it <strong>clear</strong> that it is a <em>function</em> by saying so.</p>
<p>What should I be starting with?</p>

7971,1,,,01/02/2024 14:31,,3,134,"<p>Just as the title says.  If you're wondering why I'm asking, here's why:</p>
<p>I've recently started teaching Python programming at a community college.  My class is geared towards non-CS majors.  There are a few STEM people there, and for the most part they do OK.  Some of the students are liberal arts majors or business majors who have a variety of motivations for taking this class.</p>
<p>I have a certain student, call her Emma, who was basically lost from Day 1.  After the first lecture, she approached me during office hours and said she was &quot;already lost&quot;.  I asked her what she had trouble with, and she said &quot;everything&quot;.  I asked her to show me what she had.</p>
<p>She turned on her computer to reveal that she had typed out (in Microsoft Word):</p>
<pre><code>Paint C Hello World D
</code></pre>
<p>It turned out that she hadn't even managed to properly install Python or Visual Studio Code.  After about 20 minutes, we finally proceeded to begin programming and I asked her to compare her code to mine.  She spent about 2 minutes looking back and forth between our screens, and was unable to find any mistake.  This lead to me also having to show her how to type parentheses on a keyboard.</p>
<p>This is an extreme case, but there are a few others in the class like this.  During the second week, we'd moved on to learning about variables.</p>
<p>We had the code:</p>
<pre><code>a = 5
b = 3
c = a + b
print(c)
</code></pre>
<p>Now I was working with another student, and I posed the question: &quot;If I changed a to 15 and b to 10, but left everything else the same, what would the program print?&quot;  Total look of confusion on the student's face.</p>
<p>In the past I have certainly had students who struggled with things, say, once we got to things like loops or recursion or even functions.  But those students pulled through and at least were able to pass the class if did enough practice problems to fake it until the final.</p>
<p>These guys though are something else.  Also, the people in the past who struggled on Day 1 or 2, usually had the self-awareness to drop the course.</p>

So can see what happens here in Computer Science Educators StackExchange.</p>
<p>On Coursera I'm taking Technical Support Fundamentals which is the first course in the Google IT Support Professional Certificate and I'm currently on module 4 which is on networking.</p>
<p>This is training/education designed for a general audience where there isn't any particular prerequisite to have prior IT or computing experience.</p>
<p>So there's a basic introduction to networking, and then a specific example where the IP address 172.217.6.46 is given, and the viewer is asked to put that IP address into a web browser.</p>
<p>I tried this and there wasn't any response, and then I tried pinging 172.217.6.46 and got no response as well.</p>
<p>But in the video it shows the Google home page showing up.</p>
<p>The idea was to show the students that one can type in an IP address instead of a domain name and that a well-known website will then pop up.</p>
<p>With all of the infrastructure in place perhaps it's not really so easy to have a single static IP for an example like that in a MOOC that is going to work in multiple different locations across different countries to bring up say Google or another well-known website. I suppose a network engineer could more precisely speak to this question.</p>
<p>Anyway, the course in the English language, but there's people all over the world who speak English, and my understanding is that the course is open to people from all different countries.</p>
<p>Maybe another way to do the example would be for the teacher to use either a website or the command line to do a DNS lookup, and then to put the IP address returned into a web browser, and show that the website comes up.</p>
<p>The students could then do that as well, and as long as the DNS lookup method works, and the other parts work, the website should also come up on the student's machine.</p>
<p>This is actually what I just kind of automatically did right after the example didn't work right away.</p>
<p>In the post on Network Engineering I also added some more stuff, but perhaps I'll just keep this one shorter.</p>
<p>My impression so far is that there isn't infrastructure to rapidly fix bugs/errors in the course materials. But maybe eventually they do go through the errata and fix bugs.</p>
<p>As I said in the first version posted on the Network Engineering StackExchange they could add a pop-up to that video so that it lets people know that the example will not work. Just like what they did for the one on Installing Windows 10, where after the speaker said that Windows 10 is the latest version of Windows they added a pop-up adding that as of October 5, 2021, Windows 11 is the latest version of Windows.</p>
<p>So as for the one on Network Engineering I can provide a link to the video on Coursera. There is a Coursera paywall; however, it seems that there's also three free trial videos.</p>

<p>(at about 1:47 in the video the IP address 172.217.6.46 is given which in the video goes to Google's homepage, but which didn't work for me)</p>
<p>So can see how it goes with this post before possibly posting to the Coursera discussion forum for the class on that matter.</p>

If you know only a little bit of Latin, you will probably assume it is connected with &quot;fama&quot; (fame, rumour), that it is a pleonasm and that the word &quot;nota&quot; should be ignored. But that's incorrect. The word &quot;nota&quot; is connected to &quot;loca&quot; (places, locations).

When such situations happen in a programming language, the parser would connect &quot;nota&quot; and &quot;loca&quot; to be children of a single node in the abstract syntax tree. The parser is the part of the compiler or an interpreter which tells other parts of the compiler or an interpreter which word in a programming language is syntactically connected to which other word.</p>

<p>My skull is definitely limited, and I forget more than I know at any given moment. So every year I need to refresh my memory of details. That is why if something doesn't work or I can't recall something then I demonstrate how to find it again or figure it out. Every year the software changes, the textbook is different, I am using different teaching notes or web sites, and on and on, so I am never completely on top of what is about to be shown in class. I used to reprimand myself, try to prepare better, make more notes, try out all the examples first and so on, but really, the workplace (to which they are going) is not a rehearsal, so I am <em>""modeling what I am teaching""</em>.

The examples in chapter 9 had some poor practices (while loop inside a button click event handler?) which might be improved on, perhaps with the more detailed information in chapter 10, which covers input controls such as textboxes, radio buttons, checkboxes and listboxes.</p>

<p>One example I created was of a simple method for students to ""clock in and out"" of the classroom sessions (as part of workplace readiness training). It looks bone-simple: a little box with their Windows Domain Name, two radio buttons for IN and OUT actions, and a few read-only textboxes that display accumulated time for the day and week.

In every edition we have problems with some students that have the idea that functional programming is useless, because the industry doesn't use it. The more nuanced students add that some functional programming techniques are useful in any language (they think of lambda expressions in Java, <code>map</code> in Python, etc.) but that there is no point in learning pure functional programming as you cannot use it to build real-world applications (and if you can, nobody does it). These students usually tend to infect others and that can bring an unpleasant atmosphere.</p>

<p>I have read Hughes' 1990 paper <a href=""https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Why Functional Programming Matters</a>, where he explains that people in arguing for FP often tend to show what it doesn't have (assignment, side effects, ...) instead of what it does have. However, the things he mentions that FP does have (higher level of abstraction through gluing functions, lazy evaluation and thus easier modularity) are hard to grasp for mid-Bachelor students. In the end of the course they should be able to understand those advantages when you talk them through it, but the problem is motivating them from the start.</p>

Another factor is that methods that work for beginners are inappropriate or hindering to more advanced students, and in a classroom with varying abilities it can become difficult to structure material or present it properly.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest variation is in student's predispositions towards problems solving. This quote points to a major obstacle to most programming learning:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A weakness of worked-out examples is that they may not engage the
  learner enough to induce germane load. The effectiveness of the

<blockquote>
  <p>The general idea is to strip comments, whitespace, variable and function names, literals, and thus only keep the general structure of a program, i.e. parentheses, curly braces, semicolons, etc. (for C-like, that is). Then compare this 'hash' for all hand-ins, and when you find a match manually check if the programs look alike. For example, the hash of the program below would be something like <code>#&lt;&gt;(,*){(;;--){("""",);}}</code>:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
void repeat(int n, char *word) {
    for (; n; n--) {
        printf(""%s\n"", word);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I want to explore other things of current interest that do not include web design but I can't see clearly what is required for each option.</p>

<p>What do I need to learn or do to work in currently interesting (""hot"") areas, but remain primarily a programmer? </p>

5706,1,5733,,24/05/2019 18:49,,2,338,"<p>I'm a student in the UK, and I have a computer science lesson every two weeks. Most people would think computer science is my favourite subject, as I started coding from a very young age, but the computing teacher cannot teach it properly.</p>

<p>Firstly, she teaches things like copyright and made me spent a lesson researching a lawsuit between Ed Sheeran and Matt Cardle. She hasn't taught us a single programming language except a few lessons on small basic once, which there is obviously no need for, and she could have taught a modern language like python or JavaScript. We spend a month or so making magazine covers in Adobie's photoshop. We were recently doing “Should the internet be a human right?”, which isn't remotely useful. I have shown her the wikipedia page on computer science, and she says stuff like “Wikipedia is not credible” and “I know the syllabus better than you”.</p>

<p>Secondly, we had a test recently, and I answered all the questions correctly (to the best of my knowledge, and checked after), yet she marked many questions wrong, for example, one question was “Why may someone not be able to access the sites on the internet (Give 3 reasons)”, and 2 of mine were “Legal Restrictions (eg, article 13)” and “ISP may be blocking/slowing down the website (Due to the removal of net neutrality)”, and she marked both answers wrong. She also gives incorrect answers marks.</p>

<p>She also teaches things which are incorrect, like “This spam email is a spam email because it recommends using Firefox, which is an insecure browser”, and when I say it is not, she says it is because she doesn't like using it.</p>

<p>Is there anything I can do about this?</p>

5719,1,,,28/05/2019 12:21,,2,558,"<p>I am teaching robotics at something like an afterschool but is free for everyone aged 12-19 years. </p>

<p>The first problem I encountered was poor equipment and facilities, but I obtained some funds and I was able to buy laptops, new soldering irons, Arduino starter kits and more. I was reticent to put into use all at once and I opened up only one soldering iron to see how pupils would use it. </p>

<p>Of course, we have safety instructions which include rules like do not degrade lab equipment and I repeated rules but after a few weeks pupils started to play putting soldering tip to wet sponge so water boiled and sounded nice to them, and what disappointed me was some holes in the soldering iron plastic case.</p>

<p>I am the only teacher, I can't supervise all pupils at once and teaching here is consuming because everyone is at a different phase of constructing an electronic circuit for example.</p>

<p>I was thinking to track the usage of equipment and with the very first occasion to punish the children by calling home to his parents or even to exclude them, but this seems unfair since everyone could damage equipment intentionally.</p>

<p>What should I do to be able to have all of the equipment on the table but this kind of damage to not exist?</p>

<p>I don't care if damage occurs when equipment is operated wrong or damaged by mistake. I don't want pupils to think of equipment like toys and play with them damaging them and workspace.</p>

<p>Other cases of damage:
- Cutting wires with wirecutter even if they don't need it
- drilling holes in worktable with a drill bit
- melting plastic with the soldering iron tip</p>

<p>I know, partially it's my fault because I can't keep everyone at the same time captivated but damage should not occur.</p>

<p>Thank you for attention</p>

5813,1,,,16/07/2019 00:57,,5,175,"<p>I'm serving as a tech lead for a student group's charity project. We're building a website which puts a bunch of homelessness resources in one place. There are two goals to the project: create a useful website, and let students learn as they build it.</p>

<p>The group is comprised of all levels of college CS student. Most have never done web dev or worked with any of the associated technologies. People get uneasy when I mention using a JS framework.</p>

<p>I want to make sure they get out of it what they came in for -- which by all reports is learning -- but I'd prefer that they enjoy it and don't quit (which would be totally fair, cause they are volunteering their time). </p>

<p>The group has been asking why we should use a framework. I say </p>

<ul>
<li>testing</li>
<li>reusability</li>
<li>dealing with state</li>
</ul>

<p>They feel that learning multiple things at once could be bad, and that this would be overkill. Honestly, I'm not sure if it would be overkill. It could be. But learning vanilla JS is certainly less valuable than learning React.</p>

<p>Am I being dense? More importantly, would the project better reach it's goals by using a framework, or not?</p>

5992,1,,,23/10/2019 01:52,,1,346,"<p>I was a college student majoring in computer engineering, but dropped out because of several issues (social situation, interest, etc). I always wanted to study computer science, but didn't do it because i thought that my parents won't let me (because they were so proud when i got to one of the most prestigious college in my country). When I dropped out, I got some talk with my parents and they gave me permission to do whatever I want. </p>

<p>At that time I talk to them and I said that I will go to coding bootcamp, but after some research I found that coding bootcamp won't make you a real software engineer and it's pretty hard to find a job compared to computer science graduates. </p>

<p>What are the differences between coding bootcamp and a computer science degree? Especially in terms of the advantages and disadvantages of each.</p>

6335,1,,,13/05/2020 20:56,,5,260,"<p>I teach an intro programming course in a social science department. My field is geographic information systems. The goal for the course is for the students to understand scripting in an interpreted language so that they can automate analytical workflows or add custom functionality to off-the-shelf software. The language we use is Python, but the question is more general than that.</p>

<p>Programming languages have some way of obtaining input and displaying output. There is a long tradition in computer science of starting with <code>""Hello, World!""</code> as a basic program that produces output. Additionally, output statements can be used to display the state of variables for debugging purposes. Introducing input and output is common in computer science textbooks (<em>Think Python</em> <a href=""http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2002.html#sec8"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">1.3 The first program</a>) as well as domain specific texts such as the one that I use for this course.</p>

<p>The problem I am running into is that beginning students can't seem to unlearn this after we move on to new material. Throughout the semester they turn in assignments that are littered with unnecessary <code>print</code> statements. These are ""harmless"" in the sense that they don't alter program logic, but make for sloppy code, and are perhaps not harmless if the students think that they <em>need</em> to do this and don't transition to, for example, using the IDE for variable inspection as they code.</p>

<h1>Q. Is it necessary or advisable to teach text-based input and output (e.g. Python's <code>input</code> and <code>print</code> functions) in a non-CS intro programming course?</h1>

<p>Is there pedagogical value? Does it teach something necessary? If so, can it be delayed? What are the alternatives, or is there no alternative?</p>

I'm a uni student with gaps of time in the study due to illness and I want to revise things, but because of reduced course loads and weird ordering due to illness. I'm not sure what I remember or not. And looking for tutors online they only seem to tutor in one thing.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what I should prioritize or what order to revise in - so I know what to work on with a tutor or which area to start? I've done an intro Python course, Java course re bigger project, HCI, linear algebra, Discrete Maths, Multivariate Calculus, Algorithms, Computer Systems course with small amount of C, Stats course, Information Systems (SQL and DB Design, 2nd year one on internals like B+ index and other stuff, Big Data). I've also done 2 specific Bioinformatics courses and Biology-related courses regarding Bioinformatics stuff.</p>
<p>Plus I've gone on websites like HackerRank or codename or CodeCombat or exercise. I know there's edX and Coursera.</p>
<p>Probably the wrong place to ask, but I wish I could have a checklist because the current approach of doing things on websites is not helping me. Oh, when I did these courses I got results in the top 2 grading scale categories, but because of time...</p>
